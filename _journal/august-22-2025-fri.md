# August 22, 2025 - Friday

## Daily Overview
Major focus on data vendor partnerships and setting up marketing infrastructure. Big decisions made on Land Insights yearly plan and moving forward with Launch Control for text marketing.

## Work & Projects
### Data Vendor Calls & Partnerships
- **Land Insights**: Decided to go all-in with yearly plan
  - Received 2,000 leads 
  - Getting 25,000 credits for export and skip tracing
  - Will use for market research capabilities

- **Launch Control**: Working on getting text marketing tool operational
  - Reached out to team to start sending offers
  - **Blocker**: Waiting for EIN to be registered with IRS.gov database
  - Launch Control can't send regulation form until EIN is processed
  - **Limitation**: Need to manually press send button each time (considering automation via Chrome extension)

### Current Resources
- 10,000 credits available for next month
- Land Scaling Summit scheduled for September 19th (conference for land investors)

## Learning & Development
*New insights, skills practiced, or knowledge gained*

## Personal Reflections
*Thoughts, feelings, and observations about the day*

## Wins & Achievements

## Tomorrow's Focus
### Next Week Priorities
- Get familiar with Land Insights platform
- Start conducting market research 
- Begin building database of property owners for marketing campaigns
- Develop solid process workflow before Land Scaling Summit

### Immediate Action Items
- Monitor EIN registration status with IRS
- Research Chrome extension development for Launch Control automation
- Create reverse-engineered plan leveraging 10,000 credits effectively

## Strategic Planning - Reverse Engineered Approach

### Credit Optimization Math
- **Daily Capacity**: 600 texts/day max
- **Total Credits**: 10,000 for the month
- **Burn Rate**: Could exhaust in ~16-17 days if maxing daily
- **Strategy**: Need controlled burn rate with high-quality targeting

### Launch Control Pricing Tiers
- **Light** (Current): $497/month - 10,000 outbound messages
- **Core**: $797/month - 20,000 outbound messages 
- **Pro**: $1,497/month - 50,000 outbound messages
- **Growth Path**: Start Light → Scale to Core when hitting 2-3% response rates

### Key Success Factors
1. **Market Selection Priority**
   - Focus on states with double closing support
   - Research tax sale states vs. traditional markets
   - Rural vs. suburban opportunity analysis
   
2. **Lead Quality Over Quantity**
   - Use 2,000 leads strategically (not spray and pray)
   - Leverage 25,000 skip tracing credits for data enrichment
   - Build quality scoring model before sending

3. **Testing & Optimization Window**
   - Week 1: Market research & database building (waiting on EIN)
   - Week 2-3: Initial testing with 300-400 texts/day
   - Week 4: Ramp to 600/day with proven messaging
   - Pre-Summit: Have data on response rates & conversion

### Critical Path Items
- **Blocker**: EIN registration (affects start date)
- **Automation**: Chrome extension for send button (force multiplier)
- **Focus**: Text messaging only for next 1-2 months
- **Timeline**: ~4 weeks to optimize before Land Scaling Summit (Sept 19)

## Areas You Might Be Missing

### Pre-Launch Preparation (Next Week's Focus)
1. **Double Closing States Research**
   - Priority states: FL, TX, NC, AZ, NV (verify current regulations)
   - Understand title company relationships needed
   - Document assignment vs. double close requirements per state

2. **Message Testing Framework**
   - A/B test variables: offer price, urgency, personalization
   - Response tracking: interested, not interested, wrong number, callback
   - Time-of-day testing for optimal engagement

3. **Lead Scoring Model**
   - Property characteristics: acreage, assessed value, years owned
   - Owner profile: age, out-of-state, tax delinquency status
   - Market factors: days on market, comp sales velocity

4. **Operational Efficiency**
   - Batch processing: Group by county for follow-up efficiency
   - Response management: CRM or spreadsheet system ready
   - Warm-up strategy: Start 100/day → 300 → 600 to avoid flags

5. **Financial Modeling**
   - Target: 1-2% response rate initially
   - Goal: 1 deal per 500-1000 texts
   - ROI calculation: Avg profit per deal ÷ (cost per text × texts per deal)

### Risk Mitigation
- Don't burn all 10,000 credits without iterating on messaging
- Keep 20% reserve for proven high-quality leads
- Test multiple markets simultaneously (diversification)
