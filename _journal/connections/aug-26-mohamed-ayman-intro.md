Meeting Title: Ayman - voice agent convo
Date: Aug 26

Transcript:
 
Me: Hey there. How's it going?  
Them: Hello. Here we go. How are you doing?  
Me: I'm good. How do I say your name? I'm unman. Amen.  
Them: Amen. Yeah, exactly.  
Me: I'm in. Nice. How are you doing?  
Them: All good. How about you?  
Me: I'm great. Yeah, sorry about that. It was supposed to end like 15 minutes before 12 my time and just take a look. Went a little over. Yeah.  
Them: No worries. Happens every day.  
Me: Nice. Oh, yeah. So, yeah, man, I just wanted to connect. I connected with Nathan, Iel. Last week. Things are moving pretty quick. Which is great. I love the energy. Just kind of wanted to get a feel for the team. Get a feel. I'm going to have a call with him. I believe he's out this week. So I'll have a call with him next week and just get a feel for. Because we talked over the phone. Next up is just getting familiar through voice, through a video call and just kind of going from there. But. Yeah. How long have you been working with Nathaniel?  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. It's been four months so far.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Four months.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: We started everything, built the process. And all of that.  
Me: Yeah. Nice. Pretty cool. So have you been in the land space before that, or you just got up to speed with that?  
Them: For the last almost ten years.  
Me: Oh, wow. You've been in the nice. You've been in the game for a while.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And where are you based from?  
Them: I mean egypt. How about you?  
Me: Okay? Egypt. Nice. Yeah. I'm in south carolina here. In the us.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So. Yeah. Nice. That's pretty cool. Must be pretty cool. What's your time now?  
Them: It's 7:15pm.  
Me: Yeah. That's nice, though, because I've worked with people remotely. Used to do consulting back in the day with consulting firm like building web apps and all that. People all over the world, but mainly we focus, like South America. So like, Colombia.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: They were starting to expand to Mexico. But, yeah, no, it's fun. It's fun working with people globally. So nice. Cool. So, yeah, I mean, like, really, I just kind of wanted to get to get to know you a little bit, learn how you guys run operations. I think. I haven't really, like, discussed details with Nathaniel, but we kind of feel like we're on the same energy. We kind of have ambitious projects in mind. And I'm recently new to the whole land space. Just to kind of give you a little bit of my background, and then I guess, maybe give me a little bit more of your background, and then we'll kind of go from there.  
Them: Oh, have you worked already in land space? Not only AI I mean, built AI SaaS to help land space guys.  
Me: No. So I'll go with my background. So I have been keeping an eye on the land space for maybe, like, three months. Three, four months.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: I've been doing consulting, mainly just mobile app development. So I build mobile apps, push them to the App Store, push them to the Play Store. And so that's been my background for the last decade, just helping out startups build mobile apps for them. And recently been just kind of like, been taken up a couple of AI projects, built one for athletes for getting them onboarded to, like, a social media content management platform. So basically, you can imagine, like, you have this onboarding chat that just goes and asks questions. Well, first it, like, collects details about the athlete, right? And, like, you know, the games that they've played in, all that kind of stuff. And then it asks them personal questions. That was, like, early this year, late last year. And so now I'm out of space, where I've done a bit of consulting, and I want to get into the land investing space. So that's kind of like one thing that I'm eager to learn. I got my Land Insights account, got my Launch Control account, and I'll be doing that myself eventually. Would like to automate as much as possible. Because I'm in tech, so I can build scripts to automate as much as possible. And then from there, definitely looking at gaps in the space. For land and investing. Right. There's obviously a lot of data platforms at this point. So that's covered. But I think there's now new opportunities with AI. So, yeah, that's kind of where I'm at right now. On. Nathaniel's been sharing a couple of ideas. I know that we connected. Are you in that land, investor? Discord.  
Them: Not really.  
Me: I gotcha.  
Them: Which one?  
Me: So there's the landinvestor co.  
Them: Leah or the other one.  
Me: Yes, it's le. Ah, yeah.  
Them: No, nathan is on leah. I'm on leaninvestor co.  
Me: Okay, okay.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I got you. I guess there's, like, different communities. Yeah. I'm on landinvestor. Com, so I've been sharing this conversational AI for acquisition calls just for, like, training. Right. And so that's kind of like my first little experience, like, just putting my foot forward and seeing what comes out of that. So that's kind of where I'm at now, I guess. Nathaniel was like, oh, this guy's an AI. Like, he built a voice agent. Can we kind of, like, collaborate there?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But yeah, I mean, from there you can take it over. What ideas do you have?  
Them: Okay?  
Me: I'm sure you guys have been brainstorming.  
Them: Let me ask you. Yeah, but let me ask you first. You told me that your Launch Control account and Land Insights.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Why would you need them? Are you looking into building that to yourself, or what's the plan, using them?  
Me: Oh yeah, yeah. No, I'm just getting familiar with the land space. Right. So like how, how does it work manually? Right. Get familiar with that and then eventually build processes where like I can build automations. Right? So, yeah, like, I'm just. I'm just doing the old fashioned way right now. Right? Like, because, like, again, like.  
Them: But the old fashioned way. I mean, it's kind of an upgrade for the old fashioned way.  
Me: For sure. Yeah.  
Them: And if you want to make it the old fashioned way. You got to check. Zillow reaction because that's how it went.  
Me: Okay? Yeah. Yeah, for sure.  
Them: The old fashioned way. You check on Zillow? Redfin according to criteria people who boat or sold within the last six months. So you get your comps and the realtors or whoever is on the list ing.  
Me: Yeah. Right.  
Them: To make sure that this is someone active on the market.  
Me: No, I hear you 100%. My view of old fashioned way is right now, 20, 25 is the old fashioned way. Right. What I have in mind for the new approach is, and this is something that I'm just kind of like working through still, because it's very new, but using AI for operations like AI agents. Being able to interface with these services. Maybe a VA makes sense. Maybe an AI agent and like, a VA could manage it. So that's kind of like what I have in mind for the new fashion, right? If you will. But for sure, old fashioned. Definitely. I can imagine what those days were where you were using Zillow and Redfin. But yeah, no, I got land insights. I was on LAN portal for a bit, but Lana inside has had a lot more to offer.  
Them: The only negative point that I think line inside didn't tweak well yet is the comparables because. Okay, here's the thing.  
Me: Yeah. Right.  
Them: You can compare a land to a land, but not a land to a belt or develop one.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That's what is missing in line Insights. Sometimes it's not updated.  
Me: For sure.  
Them: If it has, if it's developed or not. However, it updates the price. So, as example, if the land worth 100,000. If it's developed, it's worth 500.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So sometimes landing sites reflect it as an undeveloped land for 500. Mislead you regarding that. Conf.  
Me: Gotcha. Yeah, no, for sure. There's definitely gaps with that.  
Them: Igure. Yeah, because that can mislead you. A lot of times.  
Me: Yeah, no, I hear you. This is all new to me, like, this whole area, right? But there's an opportunity with AI. And I kind of want to do maybe. 50. 50. Right. 50% on land investing the way how it's done now, 20, 25. And then the other 50% of my time is like, focusing on building potential business with AI it depends what capacity, voice agents, maybe some market research assistant. There's so many possibilities. And so I think being able to talk to experts like you and Nathaniel, who's been in the game, It's just a matter of figuring out how can we work together. So that's my deal. I'm sure you have a lot of ideas because you've been in the game for 10 years. I'm sure just in the last year or two years, the industry has evolved into what it is now, right?  
Them: A lot. Everything is getting much more faster and harder and more accurate.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Because there is a lot of guys in the space, so. Yeah, for sure.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And AI is just going to take it to the next level. Like AI Agents, web agents, I suspect.  
Them: It's going to save a long time if it works. Because sometimes. Look, I tried honestly to trigger that AI agent on GoHighLevel. I tried to work close, put all the objections, rebuttals, whatever the cases that it can deal with.  
Me: Tell me about it. Okay?  
Them: The only problem is kind of very. Old fashioned as in just an if condition. Workflow. Nothing else than that you cannot even add to it. Or I'm coming from an engineering background.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: Yeah, Electromechanics engineering. So I kind of. Some, yeah.  
Me: Okay? Yeah, logic and all that. For sure.  
Them: I tried to invest that in go high level. It worked. 30%. 40%. Okay?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: But never better than that. And if it work, it works. If it doesn't work, it turns the leaks.  
Me: Oh, for sure, yeah.  
Them: Because you need to feed them all the possibilities. You're dealing with a machine. You definitely understand that.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So you don't have enough time to keep going and building and adding on this kind of workflow. Because it's kind of infinite. So it needs to be with more develop tool. Not just an if condition operating tool like go high level.  
Me: Yeah. So you weren't even using, like, an LLM with gohighlevel. It was just like, I gotcha.  
Them: Just go ahead. Workflows. And that's it.  
Me: Yeah. Okay. And when was this?  
Them: Four months ago.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: 4 months ago we decided to. It started even before that, but four months ago, we decided to stop it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It's kind of not efficient enough as the human interaction.  
Me: Right.  
Them: However we have the database or the kind of objections that can face the kind of data that we can see, then AI.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? Right.  
Them: The best experience with that. It was. A very starting conversation text.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Welcome text the quick qualification questions. However, if you get a rebuttal that you didn't feed in the workflow, it all get lost.  
Me: Right. Yeah, now for sure. I think now with prompts. Well, that was four months ago, Right? And even in AI Talk, like, four months ago was light years.  
Them: It won't.  
Me: Yeah, Because I want to say I've seen a couple of YouTube videos with and I haven't explored go high level, but I've heard of it on YouTube. And people have built Voice agents through GoHighLevel. So it might be, like, a new feature. I know that 11 labs. They've published a new product called Conversational AI, which is what I used for building this acquisition. Like role playing AI. And so the mindset I am of is like, what you want to do is embed frameworks rather than exact examples. I think it helps having examples. But. But then again, this is the thing. If we kind of go this route, we'd have to prototype and see what the experience is like, right? Because it sounds like you'd probably go high level. And whenever it doesn't exist in the database, it just doesn't know what to do. Whereas, like, LLMs now can be a bit more clever with how to approach something that they've never seen before. Right. As long as you provide a framework. And it's just a matter of prototyping and playing around with it, experimenting. So that's what I like doing. I like tinkering. I like experimenting. I like seeing things. I like seeing things move fast, right? Because I've been in consulting where progress is so slow, because as you add more people. It's just the operations just slows down. But if it's like one two engineers, Like high quality. You could knock something out pretty quick. And just prove the concept. And so that's kind of been my mindset, and that's kind of what I've been telling Nathaniel where, like, I know. Coming up in the next month, I don't know if you've heard the landscaling summit.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So without knowing that he was going to go, that was like two weeks ago. I was like, I'm going. I'm new to the space, but heck, I'm sure I'll learn something some systems and structure to like because again, old fashioned way. 2025 land investing that's kind of want to nail down and then from there. Take it to the next level. Cool. So that's your experience. And I mean.  
Them: Yeah. If I'm adding something to my experience, that would be the tonality. Which is so obvious on Gohi level that you're talking to an AI agent. You cannot control the toner voice. When you are sure, when you agree, when you disagree, and so on. It was so lame. AI. So that's something. If we come up with a solution for it, that will take it to a whole next level.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That you can just get it to a point that you cannot differentiate. Over the phone if you're talking to an AI agent or real person.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So that was so bad because everyone noticed that they are talking to an AI agent, and the first action they took is.  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: And block this number because it was fatal. That was one of the big reasons that we stopped using it because. Reassuring. It's not building any kind of credibility. They're not talking to someone.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Now, I've done just very little research, but from what I've gathered,  
Them: That was one of the things.  
Me: There are AI voice agents that do qualify. Rei, is it RE simply maybe. I don't know if you've heard of them.  
Them: Are you simply.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So have you played with them?  
Them: Several platforms. Yeah, in several platforms. Yet. We've got an account on re simply.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: In several platforms. They use AI agents.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: However, that's my experience with GoHighLevel. So that was the problem with GoHighLevel and not talking about them all. So that's what I experienced myself.  
Me: Right.  
Them: And companies, even service companies, they are using AI agents. However, they are not on acquisitions. They are qualifying the leads. So they are asking the basic questions, qualifying the leak. If they stuck. They transfer the cult immediately to. An agent, a va. A human being.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So that's the process so far. From one of our friends. He's using that in his system, and he's doing great already. He's still in the testing phase. But so far, so good. At least better than what we experienced with low, high level.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So our vision for that, that would be. Okay, so here's what's happening. According to my background, doing that and using launch control for almost three years now and before launch controlled platform S. That were banished in the thin air. Now they are not even there.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So the worst thing happening is leads being skipped. Between here and there. So even if you're using, even if it's a human being handling this, Some leads will get lost, some leakage will happen.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Right. So my main focus would be. Let's extract all the responses that we have on launch control and start honing on that. Right. To make sure that we have 100% efficiency. We got 100,000 records of data. We use and execute our process on all those data points. Right. Just make sure that the efficiency is higher, because right now, The best efficiency you can get. Using AI, using people, human bas, whatever you're using, you cannot reach for more than 80%. So there is always 20% leakage. Happening.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Within the process. Within the pipelines and the process. Because of the time. Because if you're using human employees, That's going to be okay. Time is a great factor.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So they have to follow up with what they got today. So what was skipped yesterday, it's lost. Right. Even if you run a follow up campaign. Some of those so you'll get better. With 10%, so you need at least two follow up campaigns. To reach 100% efficiency. And it's not 100%. That's one of the things. The other thing would be if we can use AI in this. Kind of business. Kind of role of qualifying, or at least pre qualifying. So you save a lot of time in the conversation that AI would. If I'm on the phone dealing with 10 people. And average of two minutes.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Per lead, which is the best average. So that's going to be 20 minutes, right? AI would handle this in two minutes. However, with 60% efficiency. Compared to a human on the phone. Right. So if we work on this 60% efficiency and get it up to 80%, That would be a game changer. That. Okay, you're qualified. You're going to be transferred right now. To an acquisitions manager to a human being to deal with this lead. As in a proven leader. Ready? Right. And as you already have land insights that would be amazing if we can include that in the qualification process that we don't leave the numbers. To the end. Because right now, what's happening? We qualify, then we run the numbers, then we give another call. With a number and go on with the negotiation. So instead of that back and forth, we can think for the five declines with okay, I have an estimate. I see investors, as example, I see investors in the area paying 10 grand for properties like yours, right? So the prospect will be under the impression he's getting a margin of 10 to 12 grand for his example, and so on. So that's kind of my vision, and that's how we are using launch control.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Kind of way because I embedded some templates. You already had a walkthrough launch control, right?  
Me: I'm waiting on my ein to get registered, so that's taken a while. I got that registered last Thursday, so it might take a week or so.  
Them: Okay? Thanks for the week. Yeah.  
Me: That's. That's where I'm at.  
Them: You put some text templates?  
Me: Right.  
Them: Under, so you can just use it as a drop down menu.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Click whatever the response for whatever the question you're facing. So that's what I've done, the AI and to the human agents, just to make sure you got this question.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: You don't need to think a lot. About how to answer that.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Just click on this drop down Men U. You'll find all the questions with all the answers and you click on it and go on. Just kind of save the time. So if we can get the AI to use those kind of rebuttals or. Objection. Handling responses.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That's going to refilter. What we've done on launch control to make sure that we are kind of recycling our data.  
Me: Yeah. Right.  
Them: To get. The ellipse cerebral. Right, not just descent, because right now we are just going to descend.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? Are you tracking these KPIs? Like, do you have kind of an efficiency score? What are the metrics that you're targeting?  
Them: Okay, so an efficiency score. As I told you, it's Nothing more than 80%. Okay?  
Me: Currently with your operations.  
Them: Yes. It was 60%. Right now we are 80%. So 20% is still 20 leads.  
Me: Oh, yeah.  
Them: Per hundred leads, we get 150 responses.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Per day on average. So that's kind of 30 leads a day, right? Which is a lot. 30 leads a day, and your convision rate is somewhere between 1 to 3%. On a bad day, it's 1%. On a good day. 3% out of those 150.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So it's at least one qualified lead per day that we are losing. And anyone in the space is losing because whether they are using AI or agents or acquisitions managers. Whatever they are using, they are losing leads every day. And that's why there is the idea of following up.  
Me: Right.  
Them: That's why, according to the numbers to the statistics on that. 80% of the leads get closed. Within the 8th and the 12th touch. Meaning? You need up to 12 touches. To each pipeline. In order to get 100% of its efficiency.  
Me: Yeah. Crazy.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Yeah, I didn't realize that. I thought that when you send a message to an owner, That counts as. That counts as your outbound message. And then that's it. But it's every time you message.  
Them: If it's that easy. There have been a billionaire five years ago.  
Me: No, I'm saying, like, as far as the credits go. The credits, right. Yeah, on launch control, right? It's every time that you send the message, it counts towards your outbound.  
Them: Now. It's just the initial text.  
Me: Okay? Because.  
Them: If you have a conversational conversation in texting, no, it doesn't go out of your credits.  
Me: I don't know. Maybe the AI Because I asked AI to do a web research, and it told me, like, oh, every time you send a message, it counts as, like, out.  
Them: Everything. Every time you send an initial message.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And animated one.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: So whenever you use the use batches, they send text in batches, right? So once you send a batch of 150, so that counted 150 your messages, if the 150 replied and you replied back, that doesn't count from your credits.  
Me: Yeah. Right. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, that wasn't clear to me. And I was like, wait a minute, why did I sign up with launch control when, like, simpler contacts, you know, like, they have a, like, usage based pricing. Is what I found.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But I think, yeah, I think for now, like, although I have heard that, you know, simple context is better. Like people are looking at exploring that. I think even Nathaniel had considered that.  
Them: Smarter contract.  
Me: Smarter contacts. Yeah. Contact.  
Them: Yeah. Context. It counts according to your usage. So contacts, it's. Whatever text that you're sending, it's counting from your credits, which is. I don't know. If they didn't do market research before they get this done.  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: Because launch control is just providing that free of throw.  
Me: Yeah, No, I pointed that out because I was like, yeah, if you have to do 8 to 12 touches to finally close the deal, then how much credits are you? But it's the.  
Them: Okay, but the eight to 12 touches. The R touches. That's going to count because your follow up campaign is sent in a batch, right? It's not just another text.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So it's follow campaign. So as long as it's a campaign, it counts.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So it uses your credits and you have.  
Me: Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay, so that point, it does. Use it again. Cool. No, I hear you. This reminds me. I used to do consulting, and one of the clients we worked with was in the car dealership space. And all they focused on was what's called this process reconditioning. So, like, when you go into a car dealership, you want to trade your old car for a new car?  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Well, car dealerships make their money. From getting that old car repurposed, reconditioned, almost like new, right? They make their money from that. They don't really make their money from new cars that are like 20, 25 new year model, Toyota Tacoma, right? They're only going to get a cut off of that. But if they get an old car that gets traded in for a new car, then they have that whole value of that old car that they can sell and make money off of that. So that's really how they make their profits. And so this company, what they did was. Build software to improve the efficiency of getting that. Because I think they go through alone. I don't know how it works, really, to get that whole, like that old car. But once they have that old car, they have a loan. And so the longer it stays in their possession, it's money that they're losing. Right. So how can we get this sold in, like, days, right? Instead of weeks, months? Right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: From cutting it, from selling this old car from days. You're saving this money, that this car dealership, millions of dollars, right? Because they're doing this at scale. They're getting who knows how many old cars that they're trading in a week, right? Let's say it's 15 or whatever. The number is. But that's a lot of money that they save. And that's where software comes in. And people pay, like, big bucks for this because it helps improve their efficiency score.  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: So similar model. Just land investing, right?  
Them: It's almost the same.  
Me: Yeah, it's just like, operations, like.  
Them: Because the longer that you get the property under contract and not move yet, The more is your price per contract.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Right? So, yeah, it's almost the same.  
Me: Right. Cool. I mean, there's a lot to think through. There's a lot to figure out. I have talked with Nathaniel about the specifics. How would we partner on this? But I like the idea. I think focusing on efficiency, focusing on optimizing the process. Sounds like you guys have an operation that's been. Working. But it's humans, and humans can only work. You're not going to have them working. Hours a day. But cool. Do you have something in terms of an SOP or a script for qualifying leads?  
Them: Script or objections? What are you looking for?  
Me: I think just all in general. I'll just consume it all and help AI Just kind of help me parse through it. And come over plan, because I could probably build, like, an MVP and just explore it, right? I'll be like, hey, give this guy a call. Give this number a call. It'll be a voice agent.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Because I told you, next month there's this Dallas event, the Landscaling Summit. And it would be cool if we have something to show where it's like, hey, we're exploring this concept. It's a demo. If people get excited, then all of a sudden we have something validated. That's kind of what I have in mind. Just kind of like, can we validate this as very little effort as possible. Right. I don't want to build bells and whistles is like, can we build something that's very small? And achievable. And will people get value out of this?  
Them: So let me tell you that here is I'm going to share with you. The qualifying script. You already got it. In the chat there now.  
Me: Yeah. Let's see.  
Them: Here's the link for it. And let me share the RDRs. What are the RDRs for you to understand. What is that? It's reaction, ary defense response, because that's something. And I don't think you're going to find this term anywhere because we invented that name just to paraphrase what is happening to our employees.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So reactionarily. Defense response. It happens whenever you call me out of the blue, ask me to buy my car, my house, whatever it is, and I tell you I'm not interested. Am I not interested? No. I'm just taking this reaction, this defense reaction.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'm shy to tell you that I don't know you. I don't trust you. I'm not dealing with you on the phone with that huge transaction. However, I'm not interested. So in the rdrs, you're going to find some of the most common objections that we are dealing with on each and every call.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And if you read them carefully, you'll find there is a formula. To each and every one.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: The answers is kind of having the same formula, which is okay. We are human beings. What do we love? Someone to agree with us, right?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So we always acknowledge and agree in the beginning. That's the formula. We always acknowledge and agree. Then we isolate. Is it a real objection or is it just a complaint? As example. I'm not interested. You're gonna lowball me, right?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Thank you for letting me know this.  
Me: Right.  
Them: And yes, I agree with you that if we are not coming with the right number, why would he even do business with us? However, is it only the price? The only reason holding you back from getting non obligatory offer for your property?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That's isolation. I'm checking it. I'm double checking. If it's only this. So it is a real objection if you tell me no. I just don't know. What company are you with as example? So that was a complaint. His problem is not the price, it is the credibility.  
Me: Yeah. Right.  
Them: Credibility. Build credibility. Let them know more about our company. Right, so it's always acknowledgment, agreement, isolate. Then fact finding. Ask a question. So is it only the price or is it something else? So if the answer is yes, it is the price. So we reassure that the prices will be good. If the answer is something else. So we hone on that other thing. So that's. How? Yeah. This formula came from trying to put it in a workflow to go high level. So I tried to turn everything into kind of formula. So that's why this AI agent on gohile level couldn't use that much. Because it's not kind of conversational AI it cannot get a framework or a formula and use it with that kind of similarity on different occasions.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So that's why I wanted you to know this. Because if you can use this formula and provide all the scenarios or use that kind of AI with that flexibility to populate this formula according to the equation, that would be a game changer.  
Me: No, that makes a lot of sense. It's just like understanding the psychology of a human, which, honestly, I'm not the person for that because I'm in tech. I love tinkering, I love working with computers. And after some time you end up forgetting how to act human. Sometimes just joking, but it just helps understanding what makes a human tick. And from there, it's just like, yeah, building a framework.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Again, I'm all 50% land investing 50% trying to look at opportunities for building a business around this. Not just in the land investing process, but building tools, processes, automations, AI. And so I'm getting familiar with cold calling because I'm like, hey, I have just have time, I want to learn it. Because I'm a tech guy, so I'm nerdy guy. But I also want to learn sales. Because you got a background in electrical engineering. You know, just tinkering and working with things rather than with people. And there's fun in that, but there's also, like, you know, you make money from sales, right? Because you have to sell.  
Them: Yeah. And it helped me. Because if I cannot translate this human psychology that I've seen happening to a formula,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I wouldn't be able to train the team.  
Me: Right.  
Them: I wouldn't be able to even develop myself because it's really hard to tell what's the best next action, except if you have a solid formula.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: So here is the next best action according to this formula.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Which works with human but doesn't work with AI. So in 10 years. Yes, I've studied a lot of. Yes, I studied psychology and I've read about how the psychology works and what. And this rdr. That's why I'm telling you, you're not going to find this term anywhere. Else? Because ecologic one, it's just the defense.  
Me: Right. Yeah. Haven't heard it. Though. Right.  
Them: It's not true. And how to differentiate between the objection and complain. And if it's a complaint, never even answer it. As example. Because if I answered your complaint and I took it for real. It's going to be a big thing for you. You're going to mirror. How important I see it. So leave the real objection. I'm just going on.  
Me: Yeah, yeah.  
Them: And I complain that never existed.  
Me: Right.  
Them: It's like, how long? I want to buy your own. Okay. I'm in a meeting. And I'm not in a meeting. I have a lot of free time. I'm driving to the park.  
Me: Totally. Yeah.  
Them: Exactly. That's a reaction defense response. So, yes, I totally respect your time. So, speaking of this, don't you have 60 seconds to have this done, to get this done together? It's not 60 seconds, but if I ask them for 30 minutes, Is going to say is three. No, right.  
Me: Right. Yeah, no, I hear you.  
Them: And if he says yet? Because at the end of the day, it's a complaint. Because if you're in the meeting, Most probably you're not going to take if you don't have time. To talk. Why would you take the call? Right. So it's one of the most basic. Complaints that we knew of that, okay?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Answer the. Answer the phone. And it's an unknown number, so he definitely has a lot of time.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Because he definitely knows it's a cold call.  
Me: Crazy. Yeah. No. I'll be doing that as well, too, because I'm like, hey, man. I've told Nathaniel I've been doing startup. But you trade hours for money. And with land investing, I see an opportunity. It's not passive income because you have to put in the work. You have to put in the upper. Yeah, never. It's a reverse. Yeah, for me. I don't care. I love working. It's just, where do I put my hours where I'm going to maximize my ability to build wealth and sell? I'm like, hey, land investing just came out of the blue. And I've been researching, getting familiar with the industry. And so, hey, if I can build this as, like, a business that eventually is automated, and I can scale with a couple of numbers and a couple of key team members. This is awesome. And you're already running the show with Nathaniel. There's going to be more of me involved at some capacity. It was, like, awesome. Kind of like having a chat with you. I'm sure you also kind of got to go. Got a couple of other things going on. But, yeah, I'm sure you're excited to kind of see something and just to kind of play around with it.  
Them: That's going to be a game changer because if you have this capacity of generating leads, we can actually start a whole new branch of the business to start. Generate leads. Or reimburse to investors to whatever the party is, and we can actually get a monthly subscription for this.  
Me: Yeah. Right.  
Them: At least a couple of grand every month.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Or per subscription. And we generate them. Delete. Without the human factor there, so that's going to be free of charge. Thing, only the investment of time that we put on the process in the beginning. After that. We just shoot the AI on whatever the campaign we have. And we get our subscription from.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: Because the real idea behind that. Right.  
Me: Right. Oh, man. So you've been kind of, like, jumping between what's your background? You said you've been doing 10 years of this.  
Them: Okay, so. Yeah, I missed that. So, regarding my background, I started that 10 years ago. So actually, 10 years ago I was working in Vodatone UK. Blind support. So I'm coming kind of from customer experience, background.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Then back in the time, there wasn't really cold calling in the scene. It was a new job, unknown, no one knows about it. And even the wholesaling, it was really all starting back in2015. So I work as a cold caller. In a service company, not with an investor.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It was a company provide lead generation company. If you ever heard about rei lead pros.  
Me: I've been seeing a couple like Pat live or.  
Them: Now. It's a very old one. It's when it all started.  
Me: Gotcha. Yeah, for sure.  
Them: So they are still operating.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: In a way. They're in Arizona. Scottsdale.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I worked as a coal color, then managed the team, then worked as a quality control manager. Than what else. Then started as an appointment setter to negotiate the contracts. There's a closer after that then restart the whole process with another company. Got the same kind of experience from different perspectives and start working with clients, direct clients, who kind of reached out to me after leaving one of those companies. They reached out to me to work directly with them. Build structures. Like five, six times so far. For companies with different business models, some of them service company, business model.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: That we are generating leads for clients.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Some of them were single family, multifamily, commercial. Developed. Properties. And the rest of them were land investment groups.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Like wholesaling or buy land, invest, develop it, then sell it, and so on. And I happen to be so lucky to attend. If you ever heard of Grant Cardone University.  
Me: Yeah, I've heard of them, yeah.  
Them: I happen to be licensed by Glenn Cardone.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: I attended the full course. The first time it was on my own and I attempt. It's a three month course.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So I attended the course as the first time as a trainee. Then I attended that course with my teams. We were building teams in that company back in the time. So I attended that for two years. So two years, 24 months, divided by three. Almost seven times as a trainer, assistant.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I was assisting the trainer from Grant Cardone University. To deliver the training to my team. So I happened to digest all of that. In the free time. When I attended the course as a trainer, I started to read over articles regarding why is that. Why is that happening? Why is that? Why do we have objections on complaints and so on? To understand more of the psychology. Behind all of that. To make sure that I can build a structure for the training to make sure that it's easily digested by the because there is a complaint and there is an objection. If it's a complaint, don't deal with it. If it's an objection, deal with it. So how can I differentiate without a clear formula.  
Me: Right.  
Them: If that happen, then it's a complaint. If not. Then it's an objection. That's my background until I met Nathan. Iel. So yeah. We're already making a lot of progress so far. We started it from scratch.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: We're going to have a team. We didn't have a process, we didn't have clear pipelines on our CRM, so we built this and that. And we did it. All on our own. All the sales and the reverse sales, like the acquisition side and this position size, even the contracts, the agreements, the terms and conditions and all of that we've tried to refine. Because he was in houses. His expertise is. And houses. I'm coming from land background.  
Me: I got you. Right.  
Them: I know about houses, but not that much that I know of land.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Because land, it seems to be easier. But it's a lot harder, because in a house that you're buying, okay? What's the condition of the roof?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You can see with your bare eyes. Right. However, the land. So what's the perfect test to say what's the zoning is saying? The flood zone, the wetland. What's the difference is what are the restrictions on the road? Tonnage. A lot of details between here and there that makes it hard to valuate and hard to negotiate, because in houses, you're negotiating something reasonable. Right. We need to change the flooring. You see it yourself as the owner. However, in a land, it's 100 acres of land, but we cannot bolt on it.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Why? No, you can build on. So it's about who has more clue to convince the other side, right?  
Me: Nice.  
Them: That's my background in a nutshell.  
Me: Awesome. Yeah. For me, the thing that attracted me was the complexity of leveling up. Right. So once you've done land flipping, there's, like, subdividing, there's entitlements, right?  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: There's, like, different levels. Whereas house flipping is just house flipping. Right. You can go to development.  
Them: Yeah, you got it.  
Me: But yeah, that's the thing. That maybe two, three years from now. Be nice. You guys kind of have an operation already in place.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And so that's one of the things. Like, with Nathaniel, I kind of want to pick his brain. Pick your brain. Right. Because, again, there's money to be made. Like, everyone's winning, right? Like, I see so many wins, right, where it's like, it's not just 1% of the entire investor. You know, community, that's like making the chunk of the money everyone's winning, right? So it's just. I think there's a lot to share. And I think with this AI piece, We'll talk more about that. So you connected with Nathaniel like, a couple of months? Like four months, five months? Recent.  
Them: March.  
Me: This march, okay? Yeah, Just kind of, like, pick your brain a little bit. It's totally fine. I'm just kind of, like, trying to.  
Them: First month. I can tell you we spent all the day in a meeting synchronizing what both of us have to make sure that we are on the same page on each and every step we are taking.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: To the point that he called you, he had the first conversation with you. And he didn't even tell me what happened on the call because we know that we are going in the same direction anyway.  
Me: Yeah, nice. Nice. No, that's cool. Yeah, I'm just kind of like, you know, because, again, if there's a possibility here, and I'll talk more details with him. Could potentially partner in some degree. So I just kind of want to know, what's he like? What's he like working with? Because. Yeah. Just kind of want to make sure I'm working with good people. It's talking to you. It's fun. Just kind of like just hearing your excitement with operations. Definitely have sold me on you coming up with this RDR process, this framework. I think you've been committed in this space for some time now. But yeah. Anything else that you like to mention? Or talk about Nathan. Iel.  
Them: Atlas, maybe a question first to mention if you're really interested in working with good people. So forget about me. Nathaniel is the best that you can work with. I know he's not here, but I should tell you that upfront, because the best people that I've worked with throughout my entire career here and. Anywhere else, honestly.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: Is a good guy. His dedicated. To an instant that sometimes you ask them to go have some rest. You don't need to do this. So he's amazing. And I want to know more about your vision. For that. So, being that set, what do you think your next step should be?  
Me: For specifically this, which is long term.  
Them: Let's talk short term first. Still, we have the full image to talk long term.  
Me: Yeah. Nah, for sure. I think long term, like, so much can happen and like, a year, two years, but short term.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Honestly, like I said, I want to focus on this land, investing 50%. I want to get in the weeds. Figure it out. How is it done? 20, 25. There's a lot to learn. So that's kind of where Nathaniel and I, you and I, we could partner on this idea. Voice agents, like maybe something else, right? Where it's like AI, maybe not. So maybe it's just a matter of just prototyping. Prototyping, like tinkering, and then like, figuring out is, is there a market for this? Can we validate this quickly? Like, can we get this to market quickly? Right, Because I'm all about startups. Like, I've helped startups, I've done one. It never kind of, like, materialized. It into anything big, right? But, you know, like, I. I'm all about that space bit in tech. Been definitely like the idea of building a startup with someone like a tech startup. And land industry is just one of those spaces where it's still young. It's very young. Compared to real estate, where there's just so much software out there. For houses and development, but land investing, it's like all you really have is, like, land. Insights. Lan Portal, maybe, but outside of that. There's still more. There's still more. There's, like, new CRMs that come up.  
Them: Every day and they came down.  
Me: Right. And so can we focus on one key area of the process that you got 10 years of experience, Right. You've been honing in that process that operations. And you're managing a team. So, you know, these areas and, like, I could come in, you know, like, just kind of, you know, I'm new, but, like, I have, like, a decade of experience in tech, right? Like, I've built, like, software systems and have managed teams. I don't like managing. I've realized that I just like building. Right. I've managed the 15 person engineering team. I learned so much with that car dealership software. It was a 15 person team. It was a lot. A lot that had to be. I was working, like, 80, 100 hours sometimes. Like a week. But it was fun. I learned a lot. But at the end of the day, it's like, I want to build, I want to tinker. But I think if there's a lot of value in this and would love to short term, two, three months, can we start selling software? Right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Maybe like a month from now. If this is feasible, can we integrate this into your operations? Right? Can we start validating with just our process? Are we improving efficiency? Right? Just, like, working out those details. I think there's probably an arrangement. I'll be talking, Nathaniel, like, hey, I'll pick your brain. You pick my brain. We'll exchange ideas. We'll exchange. I'll help out with the AI. And we'll all prosper from that. So that's kind of my goal.  
Them: So kind of on the same page. Except selling the SaaS or selling the whole thing. Why would you sell it?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: While you can rent it. Out.  
Me: When you're in what?  
Them: While you can rent it out, right? Because if you sell it, you sold it, right?  
Me: Oh, well, selling subscriptions. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. No, for sure. Like selling subscriptions.  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: Building a SaaS service? If we can get monthly recurring revenue, yeah, for sure. That's my mindset, right? I've built the infrastructure for past projects, past startups. I like to bootstrap things because when it comes to building software, You need intensive capital sometimes, right? Like maybe sometimes.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: You need to get an offshore team, nearshore team, that can, like, build it out, right? And then scale down, right? Like, maybe like 15. Not even. Not too big. But, like, for a project like this, depending on what we would build, like, maybe a three to four engineering team.  
Them: This is 4aM.  
Me: And then from there, once it's built. We just need someone that can manage it. Maybe it's just one person, right? Yeah. But it all depends, kind of like what needs to be built. I could be just that one guy that just builds out an mvp. Minimal viable product, and then from there. Because I also don't want to. Again, this feels like trading hours for a project. And it'd be nice where eventually I could have maybe one. If this does grow into something big, it could be like, hey, we just have one key engineer that can manage this, and I'm just kind of the guy that,'s like, keeping track of the design of the architecture, right? The back end and making. Sure that things are scaling as we onboard. More investors, more teams. So, yeah, that's where I'm at.  
Them: And I'm adding a cherry on the cake here, sending you this. Other sheet, which is talking about the dominant selling motor.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: To mainstream. You have all the questions to investigate more and explore more in your prospect. What is his dominant selling motive? So what kind of value shall I represent over there? Right? And on the top of my head, that means send you the sales cycle, okay? I'm going to type it in. Right now. And let me paraphrase that while I'm typing. So it's nine steps, all starts with a greeting. Which is a genuine one Interjective. And genuine. All right. The second point that you're going to get objections.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Or planes. Right.  
Me: Right.  
Them: How do you deal with that? The formula we set that. You have it already in your notes. Right. Formula plus fact finding. Fact binding to point what to find the dominant selling motive.  
Me: Okay? Yeah.  
Them: When you get an answer for ufac finding. Whatever you get. You're going to tweak it here. And have a kind of appraisal. So you appraise your. Appraisal. So you appraise the values that your prospect would need, right? Okay? After this. You select. You select which value selection phase. You select. Which value do you need to represent your prospect according to his needs that you wrote from the path finding question. Okay?  
Me: Right.  
Them: After the selection, you go straight ahead to the demo. Demonstrate whatever. A demo for whatever the values that you found that it would be the best to represent to your prospect. Then you get some comfort ground that he has the urgent and is on that east to start negotiate with you, Right? So here comes the negotiation.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Space.  
Me: Nice.  
Them: After that. When you reach your middle ground, we ask for the closing. So let's go with me. That's going to be a premature snatch. Do you like fishing?  
Me: I've done it as a kid. Haven't done that a while, but when you pull too early.  
Them: Okay, you've at least next prematurally.  
Me: A little too early. Yeah.  
Them: You have to trial close. You don't ask for the closing your trial close. You test the water s.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Well, if I send you. That deal that we agreed on. Do you think you're going to be ready to take a decision? And sign a contract.  
Me: Right.  
Them: If it's a yes. Okay, so I'm sending you this. Let's have your signature on this. If it's a noun, you didn't push to the close premature. You just ask.  
Me: Yeah. Right.  
Them: If I push, what's going to happen? Right. So that's the trial close, then. Step number nine, that would be the closing.  
Me: I'm getting a masterclass over here. This is awesome. Got it now. This is great. This gives me an idea of. And the thing is. Just save this here. Because when this closes, I'm going to lose everything. Yeah, but the thing is. I'll just save it here. All right. Now, this is good stuff. This is good stuff because you kind of see everything at a high level, like what it takes to close a deal, right? Because the way how I always approach building software. Is like, how can we build something in a short amount of time? Give ourselves, constraint ourselves to a deadline? And focus on the critical areas of the experience. So if we were to sell, this would provide value to someone rather than building all the bells and whistles, like adding everything from this formula, right? I think that's the thing. For example, appraisal, right? That would mean having to integrate with LAN Insight at some capacity. Get the comp record. Right? Because imagine if all this, what you just shared, steps one through nine.  
Them: Not this appraisal. You're not appraising the property here, you're appraising your prospect.  
Me: Oh, I got you. I gotcha. I gotcha. Right.  
Them: You are placing prospect needs. To be more accurate.  
Me: Okay? Yeah. Appraising prospect. Needs. First step.  
Them: Meaning does he need a fast closing? Does he need the best top dollar offer? Does he need to someone to pay his back taxes because his bankrupt? So whatever the case is and you select which value do you need to demonstrate then you go demonstrate it on step six.  
Me: Yeah. Totally. Okay, now that makes a lot of sense. Cool. No, that helps a lot. Frame every process. Yeah, because at the end of the day, Ideally, all this is just what's considered a system prompt to the voice agent.  
Them: Exactly. That's why I'm trying to provide you everything in terms of a formula or steps.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Just to make sure we can just feed that in whatever the AI tool that you're using.  
Me: Right.  
Them: With definitely you're going to need to clarify that. And that's why I want to make sure that you understand all about disciples, so you can definitely be in better than me to AI tool human psychology. You're good at machine psychology.  
Me: Totally. Exactly. Well, that's the thing. Because with LLMs, it's a new approach to engineering where specifically. Tools like this. It is now, understanding the human psychology, because it's an experience between a human and an AI, but you're trying to blur the lines between an AI. You want to make it feel like it's human to human. And so it's a new way of approaching, because that's the whole thing with prompting, prompt engineering.  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: Prompt engineering really is understanding human psychology and writing your prompt in such a way where it feels natural to human when an AI responds right. And so I can definitely do the infrastructure. I can do the back end, the database work, the front end work, like the admin, because at some point you'd want to have other customers coming in, managing their agent. Maybe they're like, oh, I want a female voice. Oh, I want a male voice, right? And all. These variables, right? So that, I mean, that's the easy part.  
Them: I can tell you, a female always better in this job.  
Me: I imagine. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. All that is just like Bell's knobs and buttons, where it's like, you know, and we can configure that so it scales, but it's just that last piece where that system. Everything leans on the system prompt. Right. Can we configure that and. Like you've. You've built out the formula. I think really what I'll do is just kind of like, built out, just a quick and dirty voice. Agent. And then we can start just prototyping different prompts. And then grading them.  
Them: Okay. Yeah. You might have a vision for that. You can do that, and we can put it in action already. And I can deal with it as if the quality control manager.  
Me: Exactly. Right? Yeah.  
Them: Send you my report. Okay. On this call that happened that needs to be happening this way, not that way.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So you can keep tweaking that.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. I think if there's, like, a feedback loop where it's just like a playground environment. Where? Yeah, you're just having this conversation. Because you have the experience, you can kind of, like, act as the seller, and then from there, You give it feedback, and that's kind of how we improve it. So, yeah, I'll play around with that.  
Them: You know what? If we don't want to waste data, I can be his prospect.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I mean, I dealt with more people than ever imagined.  
Me: I'm sure.  
Them: I've been on a lot of calls, faced a lot of objections. So how about me? Hopping on a call with this agent, with this AI Agent, and I start throwing objections.  
Me: Right.  
Them: To make it stronger. In the shorter time frame. And to feed it with all the objections. Once in a. Once in a while, right?  
Me: Yeah. For sure. I think that's what's going to help it. Take it to the next level so that we can know that it's a definitive solution. So I actually have to drop. Got another thing happening in a bit. But we've talked, we've done a lot. I think this is all great. I love it. I've learned so much. You gave me, like, a masterclass. And now you kind of gave me.  
Them: There's a lot.  
Me: Oh, man. If there's more, I'm excited. I think that's the thing. Like land investing. It's such an awesome space. So much to grow as a person and as a business. So. Yeah. That's awesome.  
Them: Yeah. And once we start to have some basic ground that we have on a conversational way, we can start feeding knowledge. I already prepared that. Regarding the jargons in the business that we can eat in.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: To the SaaS to make sure that whatever. Let's say someone's all in my land is on a 1031.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So the AI understands. Yeah. A 1031 is exchanging his lot for tax sale and so on.  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: We can do that down the road.  
Me: Awesome. Here's an idea. Worst case, if for some reason this conversation AI just doesn't feel too human, you could always have it where it's like it's a prompt. On a real live conversation with a human.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: And a human is reading what the AI Is telling. You know, it's an actual conversation with a prospect.  
Them: Yeah, maybe.  
Me: And you just have your computer that's listening to the conversation, and the AI is just giving you, like, here's what you should say, here's what you. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, it's going to be amazing. That would save a lot of time. Within the training because all the sales guys should be trained at least every week. Right.  
Me: Crazy. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, so that would save a lot of time. The eight hour straight training.  
Me: Right. Yeah, no, the. The dream is a voice agent, so you don't have to put a lot of humans on it, but, you know, that's.  
Them: However, I can tell if we can. Make it if we can tweak this tonality thing.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: That's all about.  
Me: Yeah. Eleven labs. They have. It's like a volume, but it's not a volume. It's not for the volume, but it's like. You can change the temper. Maybe. I don't know. But, yeah, they do have something. So I haven't looked at it, but I know it exists, and it's just a matter. Of finding the right number.  
Them: It.  
Me: So that the AI agent can have that. Human like tonality. It was like, just monotone.  
Them: Exactly.  
Me: It's just the same voice.  
Them: Because monotone, it's going to be differentiated that it's an AI straight away.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Because if it's a human being, However, it's his monotonic.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It's not going to make any kind of success because we have a saying in this business and in the customer care. Whatever communication based business. It's not what to say, it's about how to say right.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So that's what. It's all revolving.  
Me: Totally. Cool. Well, we'll keep in touch. Like I'll be on slack. I'll see at what point I can play around. It'll be bare bones. But if we can get something up and running, because I'm excited, I think there's a lot of opportunity with this. Is just so much to talk about, but maybe we'll probably have, like, a weekly recurring thing. We'll see.  
Them: Yeah. Throughout the week, because I know that's going to happen or that should happen.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Whenever you have a question. Just shoot me a text, you'll have the answer.  
Me: Totally, totally.  
Them: Anytime. Weekdays, weekends, whatever it is.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Just. I'll be there.  
Me: Awesome. Awesome. So we'll make this happen. I'm excited. So I'll be talking with Nathaniel Monday, I think, sometime early next week.  
Them: Next Monday? Yeah, early next. Yeah.  
Me: We'll get to see how this all evolves. But I'm excited.  
Them: And it's a real pleasure having this conversation today, Miguel.  
Me: Same. Likewise. Well, we'll keep in touch.  
Them: Yes, sir.  
Me: All right.  
Them: Okay, thank you. Bye. Bye.
