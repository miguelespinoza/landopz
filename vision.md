# landopz vision

Braindump of ideas:
- ai agents for land investing
- web agents that interact with software like Launch Control or Land Insight, using https://www.onkernel.com/
- focus on ai agents that can finish a task from start to finish
- build an arena between ai and human
- ai vs human competion dashboard
- ideas for computer-use agents
    - use-launch-control
    - use-land-insight
    - use-landstats
    - use-zillow
- split agents into dedicated roles, that have a one-to-one mapping to roles in the land investing process
    - lead-manager
    - acquisition-manager (KPI led)
    - acquisition-worker
    - disposition-manager (KPI led)
    - disposition-worker 
- have a /progress page that shows the ai agent utilization capacity
    - progress bar, that indicates how much is being automated, understanding the full set of operations in the land investing space
    - can define boundaries and limits as a user to avoid overutilization, or avoid ai agents taking important decisions
