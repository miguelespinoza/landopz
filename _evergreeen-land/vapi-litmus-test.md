## Executive Summary

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Platform**: True all-in-one with voice + SMS
2. **Strong Technical Foundation**: Excellent API, webhooks, and integration capabilities
3. **GoHighLevel Integration**: Native support with documented tools
4. **Advanced Features**: Human handoff, lead qualification, session management
5. **Scalability**: Claims to handle 1M+ concurrent calls
6. **Compliance**: TCPA guidance, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR certified

### Weaknesses
1. **Pricing Transparency**: Limited public pricing information
2. **Hidden Costs**: Third-party services significantly increase total cost
3. **SLA Documentation**: No public SLA despite uptime claims
4. **Session Limitations**: 24-hour expiration on conversation persistence
5. **Concurrent Limits**: Only 10 concurrent calls on pay-as-you-go

### Recommendation
Vapi scores **83/100 (Grade B)** - a strong candidate with some caveats. The platform offers robust technical capabilities and GoHighLevel integration, making it suitable for the vacant land marketing use case. However, the lack of pricing transparency and potential for high total costs (including third-party services) require careful evaluation during a trial period.

### Next Steps
1. Sign up for free trial (100 minutes) to test capabilities
2. Request detailed pricing quote for expected volume
3. Clarify SLA terms before commitment
4. Test GoHighLevel integration thoroughly
5. Evaluate total cost including all third-party services

### Risk Factors
- Total cost may be 6x higher than base pricing due to third-party requirements
- Limited concurrent calls on lower tiers may constrain growth
- 24-hour session expiration may impact long-term nurturing campaigns
