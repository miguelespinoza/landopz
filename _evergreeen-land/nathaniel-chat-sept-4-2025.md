Meeting Title: AI integration strategies for land investing business with Nathan
Date: Sep 4

Transcript:
 
Me: Hot leaf. What qualifies as. All of that. But on that front, In regards to calling. Do you think there'd ever be a good calling, Agent? That we could try with AI. To just outbound call. Would that be insane? No, I think there's companies that are trying to do that. What we've built, or at least the little prototype that I built last week. It's doing inbound, but it could also do outbound, right? It's just like figuring out the boundaries. The limits, stuff like that. I don't remember the specifics with the limits, but I know when it comes to concurrent. So, like, the number of calls that you have at the same time. You'd need to just talk with them, like their sales team, because their highest tier limits up to 30 calls at the same time. So that's just not going to work out for outbound, especially like, if you want to. I mean, you could spread them out, right, so that there's not 30 at the same time, but that's just a longer process. Interesting. Do you think there's another software? That would allow for one. I think so. I think there's some that allow unlimited. It's just the quality at that point. You're trading quantity for quality. I think 11 labs. This is just work prototyping. Right. But I think 11 labs, like, they have the best voice quality. And I think they've been at it for, like, years now. Like, even before this took off of AI, They've been along for a while, and so I think they've been perfecting, like, the quality of the voice. Like, I was pretty impressed. Like, it felt like I was talking to, like, a human, right? And there was probably, like, ways to get to that level of quality with other services. It's just a matter of prototyping. And getting more narrow with the results. Yeah, there's a. There's a company I talked with today. And I can't. I'm trying to think of their name. A simple talk. Yeah. Have you heard of simple talk? No. No simple talk. AI okay. Sounds like a human, performs like an AI. Yeah, it actually sounded really good. Nice. Yeah, but there's, you know, $10,000 to start being set up, and it's a white glove service. And they have, like, I think, 500. Or250 developers. And I was just like, yeah, we're gonna try to, like, put something together. And they're like, there's no way you're gonna get to where we're at. We're cutting edge. We're all this. And, like, to be honest, 10 grand is, like, it's a lot, but. In regards to the return. If I could get one deal. Out of it a year. Totally. Paid for itself. So in that. Can that be scale? D. And I'm not sure, like, so. In regards for your business. Do you have? Like, you don't really have actively, like, a lead comes in and you just jump on it right away kind of thing. Exactly. That's what I'm doing. I mean, the hell campaign started this Monday, so it's like, it's all fresh, and I'm learning as I'M going researching as I'm going. And, you know, trial and error. So obviously there's a lot of inefficiencies there, but, yeah. Okay? Yeah. I mean, that's it. 's great to get started. Do you have, like, what is the qualified lead? And what you're looking for and the questions you're asking. Do you have the stripped. And so that's where I was hoping, like the. The cold calling agency that I outsource would do. But it's like a mixed bag, right? Like, they have their script for. And basically, like, I'm building a script as I go with AI. So it's like, all right, based on the context that I provided. Like, I've done research on the title, I've done research on the property. And then ransom comps. Like, I even just, like, feed at the comps, and it's like, all right, give me what would be a good offer, and, yeah, just build me the script. I think, like, what would help is having script templates. I just this morning, because again, I'm trialing there, like, putting the train tracks as I'm driving the train. And this morning, I just came out across a YouTube video. Like how to. How to give offers, right? How to give offers to vacant land owners. And so there's just different strategies. And I grabbed the transcript from YouTube, I put it into the AI, and it generated a transcript for me. And so I was like, all right, sweet. I'm about to roll with this script. And then from there I called. They didn't answer. So I'm gonna call again, and eventually I'll answer. I'll run the script and see how it goes. Right. So that's. That's kind of how I'm approaching things, obviously, like. You know, like, again, like, for me, it's just like, get my. Get my toes wet, understand the system. And then, like, because there's. There's a lot of angles, right? Obviously, I want to work with you. I want to figure out a way where, like, you know, if it's something like a you. Know, like, already, like, done for you. Service, like, simple talk. Like, hey, I. I could help out, kind of, like integrate all that. Right. And then eventually, like, learn what worked, what doesn't work, and then we could build kind of like our own custom software. Right. You know, there's just a lot of angles, right? So it's just kind of like figuring out how can we get something up and running and then improve quality as we learn from. So, yeah. Exactly. I have. I'll share a folder with you. With kind of like the guidebook. What is like? I'm sure AI has all of. This. Information. Yeah. The thing is, it. It can, but, like, when you have your knowledge base, And you can connect that knowledge base with your AI, it's way much smarter. Because, like, if you just blindly prompt it, like, hey, like, what's. What's the rules for. For, like, what should I look in when I'm comping a property? Like, what should I be looking for? Like, what features and stuff like that. It, you know, it'll just pull some stuff out of you. Know, like, out of the air and, you know, but if you had, like a template with all that, it'll just reference the template and, you know, you don't have to go for each document in your, in your folder. Just knows where to reference, right? Yep. Yeah. Absolutely. It gives it definitely more impact within it. Yeah. I'm going to send you this. Border. As I try to. I remember where you're at. And it's a. It's a long road. And there's a lot to learn. It's just great. Yeah, I'm not. I'm not overwhelmed by it. Yeah, no, I know. Although I can see why people would get overwhelmed, right? And. So, you know, I think there's just gonna be, like, this. The. The select few that are just gonna grind it through and, like, you know, make it easier for others. Because I know that. I mean, the guys that are, you know, like the guys behind Land Insights, right, Like, they. They had to grind it through, right? Yeah. And so, like, for us, it's like we're at a point where we can leverage AI and, you know, bring on. Because I think, like, if we were to bring, like, software that's AI, like native AI powered, we're just gonna bring more investors, and that's gonna be like, we're increase the pie. Because, like, you know, there's gonna be people that are gonna want to niche down to, like, title issues, right? They're gonna work on this. Like, I can talk to people, I can talk to attorneys. And it's just like, yeah, the PI is just gonna get bigger when we bring in AI. That's my view. Yeah. Cool. You shared something. I'm just trying to get together like scripts. Then you can. I don't know which one's necessarily where. We have a bunch of, like, transcripts also. That could be. I feel like I would need to. That's gonna be gold. You use Go high level. I've heard of it. Never. Okay? Yeah. Go high level. But never used it. Yeah. Guy that's in one of my other groups that has an AI Built out within it. Maybe we can. Jump in together. It's very helpful. We need some mission for. Miscellaneous info. Yeah. I'm trying to think of what would be the best. We sold, like, 10 of our deals. Did we retelling it? All. Yeah, like little combo. You had a couple of deals. Yeah. One of them. I mean, we sold. Yeah, it's probably half a million in profit. Nice. Just to get. I think we're getting about 120 grand from it. But we got an offer today. For 25,000 on one of them. Or $25,000 profit. One of them. Just one of them. And other ones are worth like. Yeah. It's more than we. I mean. Price appropriately. Right. I just got that email. It's annoying. Not annoying, but. Where we want to put. Like it cost us 2,500 to get a contract. And then so we sold it for roughly 12,000. Per contract. It's cool. Like, but we could have done 10x. I hear you. But, you know, getting something better than nothing. But, yeah, I'm trying to find. I don't know how data works necessarily. I have all our like forms. And as you built it, it's not the most organized. Yeah, I mean, it's pretty organized in these folders. But it's not. I don't know. Easiest to share. I got you. I'm. I'm seeing the. I. I was seeing three files in the land investing resource, and I'm seeing one just came through. Yeah, I'm not sure what else to put in right now. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. It's like. And so your team right now, when they have any questions, they just go into these. These files to, like, look up the information they need. Honestly. I have a min does all the sales. Yeah. So we are looking to bring on another salesperson. And then mustafa. Manages the qualifiers, so they just go directly to him. Prospective managers. Yeah, yeah. But. Yeah. So this is a. This is. Just all we built off of. Right. I'm trying to think of what? Best. I wonder. Did you want to join? I mean, I, I. The, the sales call. I feel like that'd be very helpful for you. Yeah, that could be like a fly on the wall. Just be listening, consuming it, right? I think. Yeah, that way. And honestly, like, whatever gets me the quickest to, like, you know, like a product or a SaaS, right? Or maybe it's not even that. It's just, like, a tech integration, right? Because, like, I mentioned to move quick, and I feel like things are kind of like. I mean, we're definitely building that momentum, and I think once you kind of, like, open the floodgates, Like, you know, like, I've definitely never been overwhelmed by, like, data. Like, sometimes, like, I'm a slow thinker, so, like, it just takes me a minute to, like, digest everything, but, you know, it's just like, open the floodgates. I'll soak it up, and, you know, we can kind of go from there, but. Yeah, like, if we can, like, figure out the quickest path towards, like, some tech integration, some SaaS service, like, maybe, you know, an MVP. I know you're kind of focusing on voice agents. You're talking with a couple of companies. So, like, everything that you've done research on, if you have a document, like, just shoot it over. I can kind of like just read up on, on what you've done so far, what companies you've worked with. Or talk to, like their sales team. And, you know, I'm kind of like, just come up with a game plan for the company. Yeah. So. I mean, here's. Here's. I don't know how it looks best, but. Yeah, I mean, I talked to. Three people that have success with AI and. Like integrating within their businesses. Yeah. Or they have some sort of skill set. And one was like, you know, obviously the simple talk or whatever. I told you, I can't remember the name of it now. Right. So that's paid service. Another one, A friend who actually has the same. Charges, I think. Look at our messages. His name. Why my brain's not working today. So this is Brandon with Landai, and I'm gonna look at his cost. So here's for 100 leads. It's $6,000. Okay? It was. Okay, so I. I guess I got the numbers wrong. Maybe it was a third of the price. Or sorry. There's 30% less. Of. What has cost. So he used to. It used to cost him $74 per lead. And now with his. After integrating the AI qualifier, it's gone to 70. There's $60 per lead. Okay? That's not that much. Right. I mean you're doing. Let's say you need 100 leads per deal. So then that's Gonna cost you $15, 150. More dollars. So it's not. The craziest thing, right? But how many did your guys say? Let's see. I have your text here. You're doing. Paid 16 leads. Yeah, I guess, on average. 24 plus 8 divided by 2, so. So, yeah, like, six on average, 16 leads. So 8. 825 divided by 16. I mean, according to them, $51 per lead. Jim. Okay? And then leads are like what qualifies. A lead is a very. They're varies. Oh, yeah? Trust me. Like their team. Like, there was this one guy that just texted shure and that was the lead. I'm like, okay. I mean, I gotta do more work to, like, get to the bottom of that. So, I mean. Bare bones, right? Yeah, let me. I mean, I have a. I 'm like, why don't you. I don't know. While you're learning, you're learning, right? And so, like, while you're learning, Utilize our systems. We have, you know. Let me bring you into. A I use meat. Let me just send you. This link. And I mean, why don't. Why? I feel your best energy would go into. Choosing what we have. We have teams. We have everything in place. You can replicate it whenever you want. Because for me, I think the biggest pain point is finding. Team members. I think talking to humans. And having teams and managing and having managers. Managing managers. We're not wanting my life to be just managing a bunch of people. I'd rather manage two managers that then I can pull my levers. I honestly didn't really work the last two weeks. I don't work in the business. Really? Yeah, so you said we were despo, and despo is the only thing. Okay, I think I texted you the link. So you jump in here. Cool. Yeah. I'm jonathan. Joan. You there? Yeah. I'm okay. Here you are.  
Them: All right, perfect. Can you hear me? Oh, I muted this for a meeting earlier today on mute. Perfect. I forgot. I can't. Present. I can't move my tab. I can't change my.  
Me: Yeah, I'm your screen.  
Them: Perfect. So let's go make sure. I'm going to start a new one. So here in my mind, I'm like, what if you, as part of your learning process, just implemented pieces into my business and see live how it works?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So whether it be through anywhere along the process. Of. Maybe. What if you brought another revenue channel? I'm happy to split profit accordingly. If, again, that's hard to quantify. Unless there was, like, a lead that we can lead back. But I would say that's spitballing. Be like, okay. Here's a business. And you've looked at these KPIs, right?  
Me: I haven't had access to this now.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: First seeing this.  
Them: Okay, so this is. I have quarterly KPI. I've just kind of, like, started with a basic template and then built this out.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Where there's a lot more information that can be used. But so let's just say on average, 25,000. This is per week. Right, so 13 weeks in the quarter. So 25,000 a week.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I mean, you can look at. I'll just make it right next to.  
Me: Perfect.  
Them: So with 25%, let's see if I have any. I don't have. I could play on. Go. Why is that? 10%. We'll just play. Okay, so 10% response rate. It's kind of a little messy still, I so qualified leads from one comp, and then I have qualified leads from another. So if we look one brings an average. Of 60 per week and 152 leads a week.  
Me: Okay, okay. I see the breakdown now. You have. You have two. Oh, your A B. Testing two texting platforms.  
Them: So it's actually a qualifier. So I have this qualifier right here. Let me. Let me go and see. Yeah. Angel. So she does pure text.  
Me: No. Okay.  
Them: He goes pure texting. And then here. Does. This is when I engage response time. So this one does inbound calls.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: But it's really hard to split test. Humans. You're variables, right? Like one. This one talks really slow and, like, is kind. Her calls last maybe, like, three minutes. Three to five minutes. And this one is like seven minutes, double the time. So I guess it does quantify more. But at the end, we're seeing more deals come from Angel.  
Me: Slightly. I got.  
Them: So less leads, but more deals. But she builds more trust. And there's no pressure, okay?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So, then. So this one is doing outbound calls. Anytime we miss a call or you know, she has some text that come through. So let's see. Number to calls, hot lead s. So we get a roughly 12 hot leads a week. And so again, a hot lead is defined. I think our lena. Let's go. Okay? Got another. What happened? Okay, cool. They just got another contract.  
Me: That's awesome.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, they get roughly two again, two to six a week.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Six is the high. But, yeah, it's great. It's great. Yeah, okay. Sorry. I was looking at that. So quality check. I have Mustafa going through and making sure each lead comes through meets our qualifications for a lead because we have a bottleneck of a comper. So our comp, it takes about 15 to 25 minutes. To comp a deal. Right? And that that maybe gives you 10 deals a day. That they can come. So we need to make sure that we have our hot leads comped. And forgetting. 12 hot leads a day. We have a hand. We have a bunch that. Don't get comp necessarily. Right. We only go after the hot ones to get compliment. We're in the process of hiring another comp. There's like four roles. I don't want to get too fat.  
Me: My backlog.  
Them: But I think we need to. I want to expand.  
Me: Yeah. This is where maybe potentially AI could enhance the quality of comping, could reduce it from 15 to 25.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: To five to ten minutes, right?  
Them: So that's what Land Insights has tried to do. And we can. I'm sure you'll meet. Oh, actually, I don't know if he'll be there. If Kyle. We can jump on a call with Kyle, who built Land Insights. And I'm sure he has, you know, input on all this. So I think that that's a pretty expansive tool, and maybe if you go down this route or go down that, you know, it's. It's quite difficult. But I believe that. How much do I have? 10. Like, plug in here in a second. But, yeah, no, if that could be done, great. I think that's a heavy lift. But he cost $6 or $4 an hour, and I give him a bonus of 1%, you know, roughly $5 an hour. So. Ok. Love it. Okay. Quality check. So, yeah, make sure that everything has, like, there's, like, seven. There's, like, seven. Parameters that we need to check off for it to be a qualified lead. To past quality checks, so that's. I'm, like, distracted because they're all. I'm getting a bunch of messages with the team and then some buyers, so let's go back. Calls the answers hot lead team adherence. Team KPIs Personal adherence training one on ones. So I just make sure there's a training multiple times a week.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: With each. So every day with our sales person. And then multiple times a week, one on ones and then group calls with our qualifiers.  
Me: Gotcha.  
Them: Okay, so then let's go. Down to this is our lead manager does average of 230 calls a week. It's her time. So an average of two contracts a week. I need to get. I want to get this more, but she sends out 6,000 average. Of 80. No, that's. That seems like a total. Pipeline profit added. Okay, that was just this last. I just started adding that. I just started adding that metric.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: That was last week. We only got one. I got. I can't remember what that was, but. Let's go. Available properties for sale. That's just from me. I feel like the main metrics are down here that I have kind of financial KPIs, so. For a tire week. My overheads? Yeah, 12 grand, pretty much flat. And so cost per lead is $30.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It. I don't know why I did that, but it just like my texture, like hiring another texter. Gets $2 per lead. More so it's like I get, you know, basically a half of what. People are paying and they're qualified. Leads. So the hot leads cost me 250, 260, and then cost per contract, 2200 and that's over. 20 contracts.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So I need 80 leads. Per contract. I could. I could share the sheet with you. You can dive in and extrapolate. What you want. Let's see. Text per contract. I would like to build out the calls. I mean, that's the thing is where I would love to. I love split testing. To be honest. This, like, I wasn't gonna say it with aiming on, but, like, this is fun for me. Like, I do this for fun. Like, I don't do this for the money. Like, I could. I love money. It's great. But, like. Yeah, my. My bills are covered.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So, like, this is. Yeah.  
Me: That thing, like, for me, once bills are covered, that's kind of what I want to do. I want to tinker. I want to integrate AI, build tech.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: Improve processes operations, right? So I'm on the same boat.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. So that's kind of where I'm at now. I have a lot of angles. I'm actually tomorrow going to talk with someone that's doing just random startup. I've worked with him in the past and maybe just do like, small engagement just to kind of like bring a couple of have a little money coming in. But, yeah, I mean, like, I get you. You're trying to build a team. You're trying to, like, bring someone that's got a tech mindset. And so, like, I know you're trying. If possible. Like, how can we work together? How can you, you know, how can we maximize my skill set? Right. To put.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Evergreen to the. To the next level. And so, yeah, like, honestly, like, Building this land business. I'm learning. So it's like, you know, it's not like. It's not for nothing. Like, I know a lot of what you just. All that lingo now because of, you know, just learning and, like, getting in that process, like, quiet title. All these things that, you know, like. I wouldn't have known if I wasn't in the process. And so, because it's like, I'm not gonna build a land SaaS, right? Or assassin land if I don't know the lingo, but I'm not in the operations, but I don't want to do it.  
Them: Yes. Yeah.  
Me: But it's like, I'm doing it so I can know and, like, you know, I'll be able to, like, make better moves. And so it's like, where my options, right? Cause it's like 80% on a SaaS, 20% on my land business, or just 100% on a SaaS. Or, like, you know, like, incorporate, like, being, like, integrating. Embedding myself into your business. Right. Like, I'm open to that, too. Right. It's just like, yeah, where, where can I start moving quick? I also, I don't plan on, like. I'm just definitely gonna soak it all in. I'm not gonna be suggesting oh, you gotta make this change this change I feel like sometimes things just work and you don't wanna break what's working unless you have data to back it up. Right. This is gonna take us to the next level. We make this decision. Again. It's too soon to know what that looks like. But, yeah, again, just being open. Maybe it's just where I kind of, like, leave this land business for a bit, embed myself with you. I'm open to that. Right. Because again, I'm trying to. I'm also trying to get to the point where, like, I get my expenses paid and, like, I'M. Working for fun, right? I'm working for fun now because I like doing this, but it's still, like, fun.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Plus the stress of, like, you know, making money. It's like, you know.  
Them: I. I would say you're path to profit. Like if I were you. Like you're an answer away. Like, you don't have to struggle. That was kind of my question yesterday is like, how long do you want to struggle for of like building something that it's not necessarily a skill that you become an expert on, like building a land business. I would say maybe 10 years. Could be an expert and, like, know every nuance and, you know, and like, no, off the bat, like, boom. That's what we need to do. We need to. Okay, we're going to split off this corner because of the. Because of the slope, and then we're gonna actually buy and trade from the neighbor a certain amount and so that we can. Build another house and give them this lot for this amount, like.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: You want to be an expert in real estate strategy. Like, there's so much. And I think, as everyone knows, the more you niche down, the more impact you'll have and the more useful you'll be.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And yes, great. Like I would have loved. I. I would have loved to come into, like, had an. Like, if I was. I love helping people. So, like, I coached my friends. Like, I don't coach them. I just, like, hey, how can I help? Okay, cool. If I were you, I would do this. So, like, now I have a team. Where I get to be like, within a company, helping them accomplish their goals. Right? And so, like, that's what brings me value. And, like, yes, I want money. I don't make a lot. Well, yeah, I cover my bills, and then I put it all back into business es and build. So that's. That's what my life looks like. So if I were in your spot, I'd be like, okay. What kind of. What can I do with Evergreen? Where I can have real time data. We can hire. We have overhead. We can hire four more people. Not. I don't. Obviously. They got to be good people. I really want. I love working with everyone we have right now. There's a couple people that are like B, but I have two. A plus Eamonn and Mustafa. You'll meet him. A plus, like they're brothers, so. I would say okay. Learn my systems, dive in, see real time data. You. We have. We're doing 100,000 contacts. Like, that's a pretty large volume. See how you can optimize and then present me with like, hey. If I come in? I want to part of the business. I want a percentage per deal. I want. Like bats. That's your value. Like, here's a business play with me, you know, like, again, I don't know you that well. I'm giving hypotheticals. I'm more down to hello. I'm. I'm very interested in building something really cool. Then me just grabbing all the money or success for myself. Like, if you have a skill set and it's then you, like putting in work, like, come alongside, make value and I'll make it worth your time, like. Again. I'm not here for the money. I'm wanting to make a lot of it, but I think it's. That's not primary motivating factor for me. So if you like, when you look through this, be like, okay, let's do an inbound call bot where we're. I mean, I have the data, I have millions of records of data pulled, skip traced, ready to go. Let's put a bot, Paul. 10,000, 100,000. Doesn't matter. Call them, See what kind of response rate. 1%, half a percent, tenth of a percent. Doesn't matter. It's infinitely scalable.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay? We bring in those leads. Like, you're like, let's run that campaign after. Let's say we put in an extra 100,000 of pipeline profit. We sell that, we get. Let's say we profit 70 grand. Dude, let's. Let's split it, you know, like, to what you believe. Is fair, you know. Like, use. Hey, you have a question about client title, you have question about surveys, so you have a question about getting contact with cities, attorneys? Like, yeah, I've been turning like, work like, yeah. Learn the system. I'd say more on the. Where you can add value. Than necessarily the business of running. I mean, great. Keep running what you can and, like, I'll give you all. The what a hot lead is. I don't think I didn't find that one. Now, but what qualifies a lead. And, like, learn that great. You'll need to know and understand. You don't actually. You don't even need to know. Why or how? Because we have managers that will implement and are experts. Like they're way smarter than I am. Like you asked what a quiet title it is. I understand what it is. And I've dealt with it. But. And I've sold. Deals with it like. But that's not my expertise. I have Eamonn who's I revert to and I'll learn from him. But for me, it's the business. Like, these are the numbers, what's the vision? What's the culture? What's the how do we create insane amount of value for everyone involved? And, yeah, I compensate. I feel like I compensate my people really well because I. I don't need to. I don't need their money.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. So they win. Everyone gets a percentage of the profit in the business. When we sell something. But yeah. Do you want me to walk you through the full process? Is that helpful?  
Me: Yeah. No, I mean, I think just kind of, like, solidifying what this relationship could look like, you know?  
Them: Yeah, I don't need. Yeah, I don't. It could be a month. And I put, you know, time in. I don't care if it's helpful for you and you go somewhere else. Great. Like, I'm not. Like, this is. This is like, I'm on a playground. So, yes, the goal is to win the game of tag, but, like, I need people. I want people to play with because it's more fun. Especially, you're gonna probably look into my business and see what efficiencies. And if you see it. Great, like. I don't need anything from you. Like when we get to a point where it's like, okay, now there's money being made.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And you're either you don't either. We don't have time. It's not. It's not worth our time. Like that'll be communicated. I'm very upfront like.  
Me: Same.  
Them: Yeah. So it's not. I'm not looking for anything from you right now. Like, and if I think of something where I'm like, oh, this could make sense, I'll present it. If that makes sense, great. If not, great. Like, it's helpful for me even to see it from your eyes, just in general, and use you as, like, a.  
Me: Like a bounce board.  
Them: Bounce board. And also, yeah, even be able to bring you into certain conversations. I just think the watermelon is so big. And I'm not looking. Yeah, I'm not looking to. I'm looking to create impact. I don't really care about extra $100,000, you know, which is, I would say I ran. I hired a VA to run the business a year and a half ago. For the first guy that came to me and proposed this business. But when I took it over, it was under. Like they had lost 25 grand. You know, like it's. There is a way a solopreneur can fail and waste money. Doing this. Full time cold caller. We did seven deals. Or heated seven deals. But everything starts adding up. Data overhead and then feed realtor fees. Like we now have an efficient system.  
Me: Right.  
Them: And I would say. Yeah. Getting your first deal. Some people get lucky. Actually, I don't know many people that get that lucky. Usually it's like a urine and then their profit.  
Me: I've talked to someone that hasn't gotten a deal. I mean, they're like, four months in just selling, mailing letters. And, you know, part time. Right. And the thing is, like, again, like, for me, it's just to get to know the system. S right with land business.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: If I'm being honest, like, I would be open to just, like, dropping what I have and just, like, helping you out and, like, yeah, like, maybe there is. Because, like, what I had in mind was, like, okay, all of a sudden, I'm getting leads. They're not as qualified as I would have thought because, like, you know, their text marketing campaign, you know, said, hey, like, you have, like, a 20 acre property. Are you willing to sell it? And it was like, sure, that was enough to, like, send it over to my way. And I'm like, this isn't. This isn't enough, right? Which is, you know, it is what it is, but, like, there are some where they're, like, they're willing to have a conversation. They provided their email. But then it's like, okay, I'm dealing with a 60 acre property here. That's, that's pretty. That's significant, right? And so how do I approach it? I'll do the research. But then it's like, okay, like, is this, you know, like, you know it's? Just like, I don't have a bearing on, like, how to do the comping and all that. And I'm learning as I'm going. But it's like, again, I don't plan on doing this for long. I'm just trying to come up with ideas so that I can start building automations. Because like I said, like, I'd like to. I imagine a system where, like, agents are doing the text marketing, like AI agents. Are are doing the cold calling, like aia, like, can we lower that cost per lead? You know, cost per contract.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I know it's too soon. You also don't know me. Like, is this guy legit? Like, is he just, like, a salesman? And, you know, he's just trying to, like, sell me this idea. But, like, I think it'll also take time to get to know each other, right? So that we can. Kind of, like, potentially have some. Some relationship where, like, we're. We're working together. But, like, I do kind of, like, just being up front. Like, I am open to, like, embedding myself in Evergreen and, like, helping out however I can, because, like, that's what I had in mind. I was like, okay. I'm getting these leads, like, can I, Can I. Can I pick your brain? And I was actually thinking this morning, talking, telling my wife. Can I maybe just offer, like, just whatever I get from this. From this deal, Right? Just offer half and half, right? Like, because you helped me out with knowledge. Right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And maybe that's just the exchange for short term, but you guys already have, like, a system, so, like, why would I do that, you know, like.  
Them: It doesn't. It wouldn't make sense. Like, if you think about it, it costs us. You know, let's say for a lead, it cost us $60. So then the profit will be. Let's say it's a 20,000 or $10,000. So it's like. The probability of that lead converting. Like. It's like. I would say the lead provision is a hundredth of the value. Of a contract. Right? Like, it has its metrics per. Like. If you brought a contract, now, that's something different. If you brought a qualified hot lead, that's something different.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'm not here to like. If you bring a lead. And it like by chance one out of your 16 leads or whatever it is. Convert? Sure. Great. You can have it. Like that is such a little lift for. Okay, so it'll take the qualifier 25 minutes or the. The comp. Or 25 minutes. It'll take the. You'll take the salesperson maybe 30 minutes to an hour. If it's. We get the contract signed. It takes the qualifier 15 minutes to qualify that. It's one of our qualified leads. And then dispo however you want to dispel, whether that be. Spend our dispo versus spends an hour. That's where my bottleneck is, is having someone to talk to Realtors. Now because we. Yeah. Talk to realtors, able to double close, so that's maybe like an hour and a half of our time.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Where it's not that much, like, great, like, we'll split it. No big deal. The probability is very low, though, so I. Here's the thing is, I don't think it will be the reward you're looking for. Because we can just send another. You know, if we continue, I'm looking at a couple different softwares of batch or smarter contact. That's, you know, do another 50,000 text through there. And that will bring in. What is it? Leads. Say 100,000 or 5,000 brings in 20 leads a day. So that'd be 50,200 leads. So it's like the lift is nominal. Anyway, so I would say that wouldn't be worth your time.  
Me: Right.  
Them: To just, like, mind leads and send it to us, and it wouldn't like. It just, like, isn't your greatest value, but, yeah, we can do it. Great. I'm gonna. I'll tag you into.  
Me: It was just a consideration, right? And I'm just, like, think sharing you my kind of, like, process breakdown in my head, and it's like, really not worth it because I know for sure I wasn't gonna pester you with this, right?  
Them: It's not. Honestly, you're not gonna pester me because you'll send it to my manager, who will qualify it, and then send it on. And if there's an easy way. But then it's like, okay, let's play it out. All right, now, let's say they just dropped the leads straight into our pipeline. Right. And they'll be a tag on it that says, you know, it's Miguel lead. And it'll just, like, go through our pipeline and get followed up with and whatever. But there's the lift you're putting in is $1,200. For. How much was that per lead? Were you 60?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Somewhere dollars. So it's just like, okay, I'm already getting it at 20. You know, I don't. What was. What was it? Cost per lead. And these are. These are qualified leads, though, like, that's quite different than just a normal week.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So yeah, $30. So I get already at half price. It's almost a waste of your money.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: You might as well just be like, hey, Nathan, here's 30 bucks. Let me gamble on a lead, you know, like, hey, that's two to one right there, you know? And that's a qualified. Like, that's not a sure. That is a. I want to sell. I own the property. It has road frontage. Like all the metrics, so. Yeah, you get it?  
Me: For sure. And sounds like now this makes no sense. Like, especially when you break down the numbers. It's like, you know. I'm flexible right now. Like, I have time. Like I probably have a solid two, three months.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Where, like, if I were to embed in the system, I could probably, like, do some damage. Not in a negative way, but, like. And so, like, because, like, once those two, three months are off, like, I'm. I'm gonna probably do contract work for a while. Like, what? I do my bread and butter mobile development.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But, you know, I'm trying to see, like, yeah, what levers can I pull? Like, can I, like, can we, like, improve operations? And I think right now it's just like, learning, soaking it all in, right? Just kind of being on the wall. I'd love to join those sales calls. And then from there, it's like I start shooting some ideas, start kind of, like, breaking down, like, the cost for development potentially, and, like, doing roi.  
Them: Y.  
Me: And go from there.  
Them: Eah. Yeah. So here. Yeah. For my. In my mind, I'm like, okay, you need money? First off, I'm like, let's play. Let's play this out. Let me show you the systems, let you see the inefficiencies, bottlenecks that your skill set specifically can fix and do well. Or if you see some outside, that's great, too. In that time. There will be trust built. There'll be. You'll see things where you're like, oh, I can build this. I can add a channel, right? And I'm like, okay, if you can add a channel, Through calling using AI. Like, hey, let's do something with that, right? Like I. As long. Here's the thing is, like, where it starts getting a little difficult is, like, okay, I'll need to make hires, be able to handle certain leads. But I'm down to do that. It's then gonna be. I just see, you will find things that you're like, oh, I can build this ass out of this. Or, let's get this. Let's build this mvp. And so for now, I'm seeing. Let's say, what do you have? What's your overhead? What are you wanting to get? Like that covers? You build a month.  
Me: Just like. I mean, I. I can easily get that with contract work, right? And so, like.  
Them: But what is it with this within here?  
Me: Oh, within here, like, easily, like, 20 grand.  
Them: So. But like a month. Let's say a monthly 20 grand a month.  
Me: Yeah, I'm just trying to, like, cover what I do for contracting, which is typically 20, 25 grand a month.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.  
Me: Like working with startups.  
Them: If you do 20 grand a month, that's gonna be, let's say, yeah. Let's. Let's say two. Two contracts. And, like. Yeah, that's perfect with what you were saying.  
Me: 30 to 50. Yeah.  
Them: In my mind, I was thinking, okay. So you have, like, I was thinking more of like you're. You're expenses. Is there expenses? 20 grand a month or that?  
Me: No, no, no, no. That's, like, with savings, to, like, pay off the mortgage, right?  
Them: What is your overhead, I mean. Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm. That's where. That's where I'm at, too.  
Me: Expensive, like six grand.  
Them: Yeah. Apartment, food, like the basics.  
Me: Yeah, for sure.  
Them: Five to eight grand, right? Okay. In my mind, I'm like, okay. What? There could be so many scenarios. But what if it's like, okay, you come in. Inject yourself. We'll. We'll know again. I'm. I'm. It's pretty naive and actually insane to propose something like this because it. We have absolutely no idea, because I. It's a very low probability, but let's say I covered, like, the eight grand as, like, a cto. Or something, you know, and you built and then, like, had equity in this position or something to where you just built it out, created. Like, almost like. What is it? Smart home, get like.  
Me: I got you. Yeah, yeah, like Internet of things kind of deal.  
Them: Like, yeah, there's like. Or even built a channel that was just extremely efficient.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: By then. I mean, yeah, if you're getting. If you use our processes. And we're bringing in, let's say. Yeah. 20 grand is not a. Not an issue. That. But where do you want it? When do you want to hit that 20 grand? That's the question.  
Me: I mean, yeah, like in three. Three months. Typically, I get contract work, right?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But that's the thing, because, like, I mean, I was kind of thinking, like, if I could do a land investing business and I can automate it, make like six figures a month.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Definitely doable. There's, like, solo operators that do that. So that's kind of my goal for, like, a year. Like, figures, a month, you know?  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So just explain my perspective. I'm not a land investor. I'm a. I love business. And so, like, I feel you're like me. Watching you work will give me education of just general business. And like I'm not looking to end my life. Doing land investing, like so. For me, it's a value to see what we can do that then can go into other areas.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Of the marketplace. And, yeah. Solve inefficiencies. So who knows what I would say? There's a positive. I would say, if you want to make 20 grand the fastest way possible, right? What is it? Revenue generating activity. Right. For you would be integrating yourself into this system, creating a channel. That brings hot leads. And we will have a salesperson that closes them and then we do some sort of profit share. But again, we don't know what that looks like yet. And again, I'm. I'm more than fair. I. Again. I'm thinking long term with you. Can. I can give you every business partner I've ever worked with, and I still work with all of them to some capacity. Trying to think I ever had. Any end poorly. I can't think of, like, it's just. I'm not here for the money. I'm here for the relationship. And I hope that that'll show through my actions. Obviously, I focus in that, but disregard that. But I want to show you three lines control right now. So this is our texting platform. And I know we can get some sort of AI to run this. And we have templates. So it starts out, actually, do you know the scrubbing data process?  
Me: Yeah. I mean, through land insights.  
Them: Y. Eah. I have one of the. I have. She's basically an Ea. So she runs, she scrubs the data, she does everything that I don't have a position for that it hasn't that I don't have enough work for.  
Me: Yeah, yeah.  
Them: So she scrubs it. I have all the metrics looms. So she scrubs it and then she brings it through and skip traces it through. Deal machine. And then we obviously then upload it into here and it to go high level so that when someone calls in, The number that goes from here goes and rings and go high level. And then one of the qualifiers will answer. So I would say play around with this and look at conversations and look how many people are like, Some people, like, see one in. How do we say, one in a. Let's see if it's a 15%, 10%. So one in ten. No, that's one in ten is a lead. So probably one in 20 are like, yeah, you know, I'm open to hearing a proposal, like,  
Me: Right.  
Them: 60 bucks for this, you know?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And. Like, yeah. You're offering 3,000 like there's. So, yes, we'll sell tomorrow for this. Okay, now you get a comp it like you want leads, I'll give you $60. Leads that aren't qualified.  
Me: Right. Yeah.  
Them: And for free. You know, like, come. Come play here and don't spend your thousand dollars somewhere else.  
Me: Totally. No, no, I think this makes more sense. Like, again, like, I'm also kind of thinking long term because, like, I kind of want to, like, be able to build tech that lasts years, right? And can provide foundation for, like, the next levers that we could pull, right? Because, like, that's why I got land ops com. Like, I want to build, like, operational AI that can power, like, end to end. Like a land business, right?  
Them: Y eah.  
Me: And then from there, real estate. Like, how can we apply that to the real estate industry? You know, like, finding other pockets of where. Where we could, like, provide value there.  
Them: Absolutely.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Yeah. So I feel there's probably people within residential real estate that actually have something like this built. I think it's more of just like a community. Yeah, it's like finding them. And then doing a better job. Or, you know, because I think most people are in realist like single family homes. Like that's like if you can copy and paste that, put it into storage facilities, put it into commercial, put into mobile home parks, RV parks. Like it's the model is the value. Like, that is where you fit in. Like, you could spend. Literally go through this. Have as many leads as you want. I think I'm just. I mean, I'm kind of being facetious.  
Me: Yeah. Infinite. I got you. Yeah, for sure.  
Them: Because it's like. It's a playground. Yeah, I want you to play with it. Anyhow, so let's go into this is. We have. I have a sub account CRM, which I took from a real estate agent outreach. Platform I bought, so I can't do snapshots in here, which sucks. Anyhow, so let me just show you through our pipeline. So it kind of starts here, like, whether we called or. Yeah, you know what a no response is? Not interested listed with realtor. Missed calls.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Quality check once, once a lead. From an inbound call, like a missed call or a text. Goes into quality. Check then the manager. Make sure everything is is good and you can go in. I'll give you access. You go and listen to any of the calls. Yeah. Then they determine if it's pot warm. Which then this category is for the comper. To say he's gonna comp hot leads first, obviously.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then go down to warm leads and then cold dates because it's just. Yeah, too much work. And then if there's any concerns, we recomp rejected comps. So, yeah, about 4 million of rejected comps was 613. And then we have a lot of small valued properties and maybe later we can do like, hey, dollar for your property. You know? And there's a lot of opportunity here. If you wanted to play around with that, you could. Anyhow. And then we go into the acquisitions pipeline. So this is where our acquisition manager. Runs everything we have the.  
Me: So this is where, like, there's multiple touches. Like, once you got a lead, you're, like, touching, you know, just having more conversations.  
Them: Y eah. I haven't been in here. In three months.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So this is I don't know exactly the follow up sequence I follow up with. So I make sure Eamon manages. They have a sequence where it's like they may they go through their hot leads. Again. The goal is to triple dial voicemail in text. For the first three days, every day, morning and night. And then it drops off. There's a whole sequence. Okay, so we have. These are missed calls from, like, active leads. They're like hot leads that we're sending our contracts to. Like, these are real leads. So then. Then we qualify it again. No asking price. Asking price is market value, and then asking price. Or offer is less than or sorry, the asking price is less than the market value. So if they're asking 60k and the property is worth 100k, then there are going to be number one priority and then kind of go through the list. Like that. And this is this. There's definitely 290 or 280 opportunities. There's definitely value in this. This is a hot lead. This is a, you know everything now. It's following up with them.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: There's a lot of value in here if you wanted to spend your time. But again, you. To be honest, you don't even have the skill set yet to follow up with them. Right.  
Me: Yeah, no, totally. No, that's the thing. Like, I don't want to do this long term. Like, I want to, like. Because I'm, like. I can already see it. Like, I'm just gonna flunk so bad.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, no, I. I know. I.  
Me: Because I don't have the scripts. I don't have the skill set, so I'm not even. That's what I'm learning as I'm going, but it's like. It's gonna be like a grind. If I were to do this, like, you know, what's that?  
Them: Mean, here's the thing. Absolutely. And I want you. I want. It's like this. Like you want to create a patient human. Put them through so much impatient situation s. Right? Like, I just love. It's what was built. Like, all this that is built has been, like, insane to, like, at least for me. Like, it's just so much work. And I look at you, I'm like, don't do this, but do it like, you'll. You'll be. You'll. Be grateful.  
Me: Oh, no. Yeah.  
Them: All the. The wasted money to build this and whatnot anyhow. So let's go back here. So. And I'm again, I mean, I'm a little cheeky, you know, like, I just.  
Me: That's.  
Them: Like I like, you know? Anyhow, you'll. You'll figure it out. Okay. So cold. Follow up warm callbacks hot. Full up and then contract sent. Yeah. Then it goes into the dispo. Where? Yeah, that's. That's pretty straightforward.  
Me: Yeah. Sure.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I, I, I would love to, like, if possible, just shadow. Like, how does someone does it? Like, you know, tactically? Like, that's kind of how I learn.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And like again, fly on the wall.  
Them: Yeah, well, that's what I'm wanting to do now. So what? Point have you seen? I'm assuming it's gonna be in the acquisitions pipeline. Of like, okay, we have. Where is that? Big list. So 10 million of dollars of people that have wanted to get offers now, like, hot at one point.  
Me: If you click on one, like, what's that look like?  
Them: Yeah. Okay? So it starts at the top. So.  
Me: These are carried over from launch control or is it just like for cold calling?  
Them: Yeah. So we use launch control as just an inbound marketing stream. We don't use it as like a qualifier. So in launch control, there's probably so many leads that can be qualified. There's so much opportunity in there still. But we want to talk to people who want to talk with us, who want an offer. And, like, right. We don't want to get our civ. Or I don't know what it's called. Maybe a sieve. Yeah. To be too tight. Like, we don't want a bottleneck of two diet where we have, like, thousands of leads that we milk each one for the, you know, most. We have one qualifier. We wanted this, like, simple team.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: With one qualifier. You know, like, I think what we have is great for now. There's two things. I would say your biggest value is probably going to be. Qualifying like. Like building a system that uses all our transcripts, all our data to qualify leads. And then follow up. Those are the. Those are the two main areas where I feel like your expertise would be valued. And I'll bring you in with Mustafa, who's the expert in qualification.  
Me: Cause, I mean, like, one thing that I'm thinking about is, like. Mining all this data. Prioritizing it based on the value rather than just going down a list. And I don't know if you're already doing that where, like, you're sorting it in such a way where, like, you're working for. You're targeting, like, highest value first. Right? Or is it just like you're going down a list and it's not sorted in any way?  
Them: Yeah. That we've. We've tried a couple different ways, and I think we've. Prioritized the motivation over the value.  
Me: Okay? Yeah.  
Them: So if you. If we look at.  
Me: Well, even that. Like, that. That's a key metric right there, where, like, you can have an AI just, like, plug in, listen to the conversation, analyze it, do some, like, sense. Like, was it, like, sentinel analysis? It's not gonna be, but it's like you're just doing analysis on, like, the positivity. Or the negativity, like, how motivated they are, like, how positive ly they are motivated to, like, sell and, like, yeah, that could be prioritized, right?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I don't know if, like, Astro would have some way of, like, plugging that in. But like that, then that comes to mind.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Right speed to contact with motivated dollars, I think. Yeah. I didn't know it was, like, high value. It sounds like motivated sellers. That makes a lot of sense. Because it's easier to work with.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Light. Higher conversion, right.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'd rather get one $20,000 deal where he really wants to sell than a million dollar deal where he won't talk to, you know.  
Me: Yeah, for sure.  
Them: I actually have. Yeah. I have another guy I want to bring in to just converse with you once you kind of like, I'm gonna give you access to everything.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like this. The. The main things is gonna be launch control. You can see the conversations.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And there's millions. Of. I don't know if I've hit millions of conversations yet.  
Me: I mean, that's wild. If they're all inbound.  
Them: Yeah, it's all in, ben.  
Me: For sure.  
Them: So, let's see. Times 20 days. Times, actually. This should be a metric on here.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: My. My month is short. Let's go. 3500. 350, 000. That seems a little low. Because we were doing okay. Yeah. Three months. Yeah. Okay, so I've only sent 350, 000. Right. So there's millions of. I. That's where my millions is wrong. I've pulled millions of records. One. So out of 100,000 records I get or. Sorry. Out of 100,000 records pulled, I'll get 5,000. So what is that, 0.5%?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Of, like, just general us, like. Yeah, anyhow.  
Me: Gotcha.  
Them: Yeah. 350, 000. I thought it was more 100. Three months. Yeah. You could see it's been three months of, like, full time.  
Me: Right.  
Them: And that's not long at all. That's not a lot of data, but yeah, 300,000. Sent and then 32, 000 received. So, yeah, that's a lot less than I thought. But out of 30. Yeah, I'm sure you can go through and however you scrape data, finding that, that would be huge. See, that would be huge to be able to pull. The highest motivate like you find what I don't know if you can do, Tone. On text, but like finding the highest motivated. Maybe words.  
Me: Yeah, right.  
Them: One of them down and then even integrating them into this site. So let me.  
Me: Like, there's gonna be a little. Every data point helps a lot, right? Like, depending on like. Like speed of reply, right? Like, if it takes. It took them like a day, two days to reply. Then maybe they're just really just dragging their feet. But if it's like 10 minutes apart, where it's like, okay, that's the data point, you know, like, they're responsive, right?  
Them: That's huge.  
Me: Yeah. So stuff like that, like, it'll. It'll. It'll be just kind of get a sense of. And again, like, I haven't actually done text marketing. I got my, like, launch control approved. Yeah. Like, two days ago or so. So it's like, if you. If you want to use it for, like, another marketing channel, like, go ahead. I got that. I got the 10 dlc also approved.  
Them: How big is your plan?  
Me: It's the base plan, so, like, 10,000 outbound. But you know you could always upgrade, right?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But I think what's gonna help is just like, yeah. Just soaking all this up, right? Like, and then I'll ask you more specific questions because it's, like, a lot to, like, you know, I feel like right now, like, you can show me a lot. But I'm just gonna, like, dive into it, because, like, once I can dive in, understand the process, it's like, okay, I can piece a lot of things together, and then I can have a call with you or maybe your managers for, like, 30, 40 minutes, asking them specific questions, like, okay. I see this. Can you give me more details so that I can paint a bigger picture of that process?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I think maybe, like, I'll work on this. Like, I guess we're not connecting anymore. Like, this was our call. Like, because we were thinking, like, 5:00 with Aman.  
Them: Yeah. No, I have an interview then, so that's why. Yeah, we're doing it now, but we can. I can pull them into anything. That makes sense. This is obviously balanced. Point of, like, you being educated and I'm happy.  
Me: Right.  
Them: To spend time. Like, any question you have of, like, even I know that you want to kind of run through this conversation like how this goes. Did you want to? Are you able to hear? Let's see. Can actually, I have it muted because I hate. I don't. I don't calls.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Okay, let's go to this one.  
Me: Yeah, here's the thing. Like, I also have experience building chrome extensions. Like, I started off way back, like, eight years ago. I worked at Uber for, like, two years, just kind of, like, helping out build Chrome extensions for, like, internal tooling.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And so, like, had a lot of fun building, like, chrome extensions, right? And so you can imagine a chrome extension that's embedded there for user, for your team. To, like, expedite, like, you know, one process or two processes, right?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Like tools that are embedded in systems like that helps teams like 5x10x their time, right?  
Them: Okay. Yeah. I mean, I'm don't. Yeah. I. I see. I don't even notice what tools there are, so that's that.  
Me: Oh, yeah. Like with a chrome extension you can embed, kind of like. Imagine there, like at the top right corner, you have another bubble, like right, right to the left of the telephone.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Right? You can have like, an. Like a AI button, right? You click it and it, like, embeds in this view and starts doing magic, right?  
Them: Cool.  
Me: And, like, that's key because, like, sometimes you can't extract data because, like, data is enclosed in whatever service you're using, right? And this could be something where, like, you may not be able to market it because it's like, maybe you're going into, like, terms of use, but, like, you built a tool specific for your business. To, like, 10x it, right? So you may not be able to sell it because, like, you're building a service on top of an existing service. So there's, like, legal issues there. But if you build it specifically for your team, they 10x you10x your profit, potentially. Then, you know, that's. That's another key thing there. So I'm telling you, man, like, I think I'm just gonna have to, like, soak it in.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then from there, because, like, I. Yeah, all these things are, like, basic things that I can just, like, quickly navigate. Right. Instead of, like, us just going through this, like, step by step. I'll soak it up all up. Like a day two. Give me like, maybe like Saturday. I can just start asking questions. You don't have to answer it. Whenever you get a chance. I could just send messages, right?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Even videos, right? Just kind of, like, break down my thinking process and, you know, go from there.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, that sounds. That sounds good. I mean, yeah, I feel like, just so you understand what our current process is and where you can. Like, this is in the. In the qualifying. I think is your greatest skill set. I wouldn't worry about Despo. I'm worried about you know that that stuff will happen when you get a good qualified lead.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Let me just see if you can, like. I just want you to hear one call. Is if Travis.  
Me: I hear it.  
Them: Yeah. Hi, Travis. Well, yeah, I'm not gonna take too much of your time. I am just inquiring about your property. And keywords. County with 79.75 acres. Are you looking to sell it? I wasn't really. Whoa. Would do? I mean, would you consider possibly selling? Yeah. I mean, I'd consider it. It's not like it was something that was really at the forefront of my mind, though. Okay, then. So I just. I'll just need to ask a few questions about a property. Is the property vacant? It doesn't have any structures on it. It has a clear road access and you are disabilityal owners. That right? Correct. Ok. And well, does it have any kinds of improvement, like force of electricity, water that even vents? No. Okay. Well, yeah. Thinking of selling or would consider possibly selling? I just want to show up the question directly what you're asking for us or how much is your bottom line for the property? No, I don't. I mean, I guess you guys reach out to me if you guys have an offer on it. Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. We'll definitely get back to you with an offer. But at least. I just wanted to know, like, aside from the price or the offer. Is there anything else I need to focus on? Just to take you all the way to finish line. No, not really. I mean, there's just pouring there right now. Okay and apart from that one is ever regarding to a deal do you have any specific time frame for so I mean you can go through and listen but like this is where I feel in AI agent. That would do a lot better at communicating English.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Than a cold call er. The Filipino, right?  
Me: Dude.  
Them: And I I would want to split test communicating. Hey, this is an AI agent. And, like, communicating it versus just going for it.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I'd want to, then. So that's. That 's something I want to replace. Is the. This, like, to be honest, this conversation, I can poke so many holes in it.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: Like. They know what they're going for, they know what they're getting at, and he's not even interested. So it's, you know, low, low value lead. But that. That's easily, like, replaceable right there. Okay, then. Coming into. We have a template for everything we. We want to get from each lead. And I want AI to be like, hey, you guys got power. Is it fence? Like, it was. Like, it's not.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Fence. No. You know, like, certain things like that.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So that's y.  
Me: That for sure. Easy. Like, I've already, like, looked into it. It tracks data and it, it gives it to you cleanly. Like, you don't even have to pick through the transcript and read through it. It just, like, extracts it. So, like, imagine like, yeah, VA happened to, like, read through a voice agent transcript. You don't have to do that. Like, the voice agent actually goes, ahead and extracts that data.  
Them: Eah. Perfect. Yeah. So this. I'd love to see. Yeah, you work that out in the hide? This. I went to the bottom. So then I have the land insights link. And like a comparable.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Or the comping link. So there's. Like AI comp. Values, to be honest, are way off. They. I wish. I wish they could get close, but they're. They. 're maybe this one is closer, but 70% of them, I think. I built out a sheet with all of ours that were confirmed by realtors and everything. That's way off anyhow, so that's been sent to quality check, which. This is Mustafa.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah.  
Them: Not that interested. Wants an offer, you know, floodplains, 11%. Yes. Slope.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Let's see. I think it's. I can't remember what the W stands for. Something like water. Flood.  
Me: Wetland, maybe.  
Them: Yes, wetland. It was something with the water. So then. Then this lead probably should didn't need to get comp. Like it was just such a low value that you never know, right? One in every hundred or one in every eighty. Except the offer. So then he ran the comps. The arv is here. I give like I give a special bonus if she gets it at 30%. But like. Like it'll come at like 60 to 70. Like, we look for a minimum 20,000 profit per deal. So, you know, we have Lena's conversations.  
Me: Throw it away.  
Them: Which everything's everyone's global talent. So she swim egypt?  
Me: Yeah. And see, I. I have, like, high expectations, so, like, I went with us voice dialers. With lead mining, so that might be why it's also, like, 85 per lead. Right. And so it's like, from what I. Like, my understanding, I mean, for all I know, like, they're. They're not. But, like, apparently us based, like, yeah.  
Them: Are they us based? They're really us based. Hello. Hi, travis. Yeah. Well. Hi, Travis, this is Lena. The. Wow, that was cool. But with texting, because you said they're qualifying via text or via cold call.  
Me: It's you get two packages, right? 00 dials. That's 825. And then 2,000 SMS. I think it was like 200. I don't know how much that was for SMS. And it's very likely for SMS or not you using us, but. Yeah, so. Because I think for, for, for their international. I don't know what they use. Like, Vietnamese, maybe, like, but. Or Philippines, but yeah, it was, like, half of that, I think. Yeah. I'd have to look at their pricing. But it's just one thing that stood out to me because, like, from what I've heard, it's like the first impression is what? Like a lot of the vacant land owners, you know, expenditure, it was like, oh, yeah, like, you know, you're, you're. Not from you as like just hang up, right?  
Them: Yeah y.  
Me: A voice agent that's native, you know, American voice. It's like, yeah. I think it's all about, like, testing it, though, and seeing, like you said, you have ideas for, like, how to a B test and try out different variants.  
Them: Eah. I mean, he. Here's the thing. It's like I could hire US based and pay, let's see, 4, 8, 12, 16, 4, 5 times the price.  
Me: For sure.  
Them: And if someone wants to sell, that's, like, part of the funnel, right? It's like, if they're willing to talk to someone.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: That's part of the funnel. Not that I want it to be, but if again, let's see. Trying to think of your. Let's see. Do you want to stick with your. Let's see what.  
Me: I don't know what email you got, but. Whichever one works for me. Honestly, like.  
Them: Yeah. Big gabe. Yeah. Blue acres.  
Me: East blue acres? Yeah.  
Them: Is that a new one?  
Me: No, that's the one I got. East blue acres. I'll just message you.  
Them: How do you manage? Oh, I got it. I have it here from a Google meeting. Is that the one you want to, like, stick with?  
Me: Don't really matter. Sure. I mean, that works for me.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: It's a temporary. It's. It was kind of like my. Just to kind of get in front of people. Cause, like, again, like, my whole goal was, like, talking of, like, people in the industry and seeing what could happen.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: AI is so fun right now, man. Like, I built my little website, east blue acres, and I just used AI like image generation.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Blown away with what it could do.  
Them: I'm sure it's.  
Me: That's another thing. Like, actually, I had even thought this idea of, like, flyers. Like, flyers for text messaging, but you're doing inbound, so that's what, you know, like. But, like, I don't know if that's even a thing where, like, instead of just text, just sending. Liar. Right?  
Them: Yeah. Here's. Here's. Let me see. Yeah, here's the thing. It's like I am. I am. More than happy. To, like, test anything. Right. And I'll easily take one of my cold callers. And move them on to another channel or like, let's say a couple hours a day, they respond to flyers. Right.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like I'd be happy even in one day a week. We're, like, taking one of them. And just being like, okay, you're just responding to these leads. We're not gonna send out text. Like, there's maybe a day, a month. Where we don't have text, so they just do follow ups.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Always. We have best response rates, we have best conversion rates. On new leads.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: More than follow ups, more than any of that. So, yeah, I just gave you access to this. I'm gonna give you. Let's go to last. You have last pass with that email.  
Me: Oh, I have one password.  
Them: One back. Okay. Will it work with. Because I In order for me to share my like launch control.  
Me: Yeah. Oh, I gotcha. Yeah. I mean, I can create a last pass account.  
Them: I'll send it to you. It'll. It'll go to that email shared. So that's launch control. Go high level. I think that's all you need for now.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So that's your. That's the outbound. And then. Yeah. Then the qualification process. And I would love I have another guy again that's built. He's again part of another group that I've been talking with. He's built an AI agent to qualify all his realtors. And his leads for houses. And he's happy to share.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So maybe once you're like, once you've looked through, I'll send you. We'll jump in a meeting with him. And kind of you guys can communicate on your go, on your. On your AI and HE to communicate the GoHighLevel special snapshot that he has.  
Me: Okay? Yeah.  
Them: Right now building out a new. Because you can't do it with the sub account. I have to start a new account. So I'm starting a new go High level. He said he'll import it and everything. So.  
Me: Okay, so right now I have go high level. I have launch control. And then. And then. Was it that blast? Astro Blast?  
Them: Yeah. So that's go high level answer. Last year is just a white labeled go high level.  
Me: I see. I gotcha. Okay.  
Them: I'm gonna start another GO high level account. Where? We can obviously do whatever we want with it if we want to do texting, like import all the templates. So one of the things, if you have questions, which I hope you, you do, because that means you'll you're looking into it. Let me just share. Because there's a lot of. I'm sure you understand, like, with tech, everything is the same, but knowing where to find it can sometimes be annoying.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So obviously, this is where you import your leads.  
Me: Right.  
Them: We don't skip trace here.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I don't. I wonder. I don't know how much they cost for that.  
Me: Yeah, I already gone through all this. Like, I. Yeah. Launch control, like, I've already. I got onboarded and so, like, they broke down everything for me. I did. I imported my skip trace data. I skipped trace using landinsight. So it's just. Yeah. Like, for sure. Like, for me, like, the biggest thing would be just kind of like reading through the processes, the templates, you know, stuff like that. What's working, what's not working.  
Them: Y.  
Me: Because, like, again, like, all this data is so valuable, right? And I might even, like, they might not have an API.  
Them: Eah.  
Me: For to extract this, but like with a chrome extension. Like, dude, I had land stats and built a chrome extension that, like, extracted all the county data for me so that I could, like, see metrics of, like, the sell through rate. And, like, I did my own little table so, like, all this can be extracted, right?  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: And then from there, what I see valuables, like the delivery. The response, like which one's responding most. And, you know, like, figuring out how to integrate that all into, like, a seamless operation.  
Them: Absolutely. So that's. That's where I'm. I'm thinking of. Like. Yeah. There's so many things I. I know you'll find. Value. To be able to build something and even, like, use us as, like, a guinea pig, where you're seeing immediate response, you know? Five thousand. Data points a day that then lead into the lead flow. So you should have access to this. Now, once you set up your account,  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, this is what I was gonna just say. The templates, I'm looking to, like, keep. Try to keep my llc. I'm gonna start another one so it's. I'm not exposed. To the same level of. Yeah, getting sued. I need to look into that.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: But this is already worded in a way. That I may run into is sending out. So pricing. This account costs $2,800 a month. For 100,000. Go high level, cost 99 or 199 and then $800. So about 900 something. To do the same amount of volume. So. But the problem is you have to scramble, like here, they scramble these like they scramble the words. Like this one will all be the same. But then they use this variation, with this variation, with this variation. You know. You know how they. I'm sure they explained it to you.  
Me: Right.  
Them: I keep you from being blocked. That's something. Where? I don't know. Is there something you can do with sending messages? Like go high level to scram. Let's say you use CRMs before, right? Like you could build out automations.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Yeah, to do anything you needed to do.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Is there a way to scramble the words?  
Me: Yeah, we'll have to look into that because this is all like capabilities that if Go high level doesn't support. It looks like maybe what you could do here is like, I think you can even like, connect with third party services like Google Sheets, like Air Table, right? So, like, you could probably even connect with, like, a third party. Or maybe even. Yeah, I could even build, like, my own little backend. It's, like, probably, like, 10 minutes, and it just hits that back end. And it, like, spits out, like, a string through different versions.  
Them: Yeah. No, I.  
Me: But, yeah, I mean, any. Any pain points you have, like, just list them out. I'm definitely not gonna prioritize them because, like, I kind of want to, like, focus first at a high level, like, everything that's involved and, like, you know, from there, I'll start nitpicking every little thing.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That's just the process. It'll take some time. Like, it's a discovery process, but I'm eager to, like, dive into it. You'll probably hear from me. Probably. Like, yeah, like, again, like, for me, like, I love working, but I also love spending time with my family. So, like, right now, in a bit, I'm gonna head out to the park.  
Them: Good.  
Me: Tomorrow, Friday. Typically wrap the day, like, around 3. But, like, Saturday morning, I wake up early, work like, two, three hours in the morning. And then lately, baby schedules, like, way off. So, like, I work it at 9, work to, like, 12 at night, you know, so I'm all over the place. Right. But definitely, I think we'll soak it up and should at the latest. Like Monday. Right. At the latest Monday. I'll probably have another call with you just to kind of like, you know, hit the ground running.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah.  
Me: And figure out, you know, areas that we could investigate more. Right? Because I think you're the funnel tours, like. Cause I definitely wanna be mindful of your managers. Cause, like, I get it, right? You know, they're running businesses. You're the business. And so. But, like, I wanna get to a point where, like, okay, now we start getting input from them, right? Like now we start to, you know, gather insights.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: More detail so I get a full understanding. So I'm not sure how I'll be formulated, but I'll get to that point and we'll go from there.  
Them: Yeah. Perfect.  
Me: Because I want to see something tangible soon, you know, how many are you gonna just dive into this? See something tangible, even if it's just something small? Yeah, if you wanna go in with, go high level.  
Them: Yeah. So here's the thing I would say. If, like, the word I guess we use is, like, abuse us, like, let's. Let's, like, we are all going for revenue. Right. And building processes that like our resilient and create a lot of value. That's the goal for you too, like, and I think if you can utilize our processes and learn from it and even build your own or whatever needs done. Our managers are at your disposal. So, like, don't hesitate, like, if you have a question the way I think. Yeah, I just, I. I see it as, like a multiplying effect. Like, if you wait a month to ask a question. If you ask a question right now, and we can help you, like.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: We'll do it now. Right? So don't do. Don't hesitate. You're not taking away from them. You're. They're one message away. I honestly like this is. The fun part for me is we're exploring, we're building. We're creating. And that's like. So it's not. It's not taking away from business. Honestly, our business is fine.  
Me: Exactly.  
Them: And I. I Hope we can 10x. Like, 10x sounds insane. You know, like, especially with keeping the same size team, like, low overhead. And just cleaning our again. Having a website that can send and manage texts. I know that you got to go to the park, so I'll let you.  
Me: Now. Fifteen minutes, whatever you got.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Shoot.  
Them: Well, just those two things. Of sending out the text and managing them and then qualifying them for, like, motivation.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And then. And I'm sure. Yeah. And then also, once they're qualified, Following up with them in a way that keeps them engaged. So that's where we currently have. I would like to build another channel. For cold calling. Whether that be full automated cold calling or texting. Gets calls received. We can send out ringless voicemails too. Like tens of thousands of them, they inbound AI agent qualifies. And then we go from there. Yeah, there's so much that can be done. There's so much in this market and then copy it to another market. So don't hesitate to reach out any questions you have. Look, I'm down to jump on three hours a day if that's what it takes to, like, build something that can. Even double the business like I'm. It's running. So now how do we make it better? So that's. That's where I'm at, so.  
Me: Exactly. That's where I'll bring my skill set. So I'm really eager. I'm really excited to dive into it, so you'll definitely be hearing from me soon. Yeah, I'll definitely go do a little park trip. And then I was gonna join the Land Insights had a webinar with Ajay for objection calling. I'm like, I'm gonna drop it. Cause.  
Them: Rt yeah, the public one or the weekly one?  
Me: It's a public one. It's like a two part series.  
Them: Okay? Yeah.  
Me: The one this past Tuesday.  
Them: Y.  
Me: And gonna have one. I know it's a plug for him for landscaling summit, so. And I'm already going, so it's like, it's cool.  
Them: Eah. Yeah.  
Me: But now it gives me time. Now, that freed up time. And I'll be looking into this when I come back, and I'll take notes, and we'll go from there for sure.  
Them: Perfect. I'll send you. I think I still have your. I'm gonna send you just a list of the KPIs if you want to, like, dive in and look at them.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: I'm gonna send that to your email.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And then if you even see anything where you're like, hey, I think this KPI should be edited. Or like we need to track other metrics. Again. We've just been. Yeah. Building as we go, so.  
Me: Right now. I see. I mean, you just started tracking a couple of data points this past week.  
Them: Yeah, yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah. Well, cool. Yeah, let's. Let's let me know when you want to jump on a call next. And I also want to bring in. Yeah. Someone else again with the. With specifically the AI qualifying in go high level, and he has a snapshot that he'll drop in. And, yeah, we'll get. We'll get there on the next call, maybe.  
Me: Okay. Yeah. Now, you said you're gonna have a call with him or interview him.  
Them: No, we've already had calls. But it's more. I need a setup. I need some work of setting up the account like the new account that then can this snapshot that can also accept his AI bot. And then it needs tailored to land because he's in houses.  
Me: Right. And is this tool public? Is that something.  
Them: He. He built it.  
Me: Right, but is this something that he could share with others? Is there, like, a website for it, or he's just, like, privately sell?  
Them: Privately, just showing it. It's free. He's like a friend hooking it up kind of thing.  
Me: Gotcha.  
Them: But I'm sure we'd be able to build off of it.  
Me: Cool. Right, okay.  
Them: Whatever you have. So, I mean, that would be more your language, talking with him.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So.  
Me: I was gonna say, like, if there was something public where I could just look into it and see how, like, what capabilities the AIs got. I mean, I get it, right? It's just lead qualifying agent, but just to kind of.  
Them: Yeah, Let me. Let me just put you in a text. With him.  
Me: Sweet.  
Them: Tie.  
Me: Yeah, like, ideally sometime early next week. We could hop on a call and, like, if you have the new Go High level account and, you know, like, we have a good game plan. Yeah, I can kind of, like, look into that.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I mean. I feel like my game plan. You said when I have a game plan, and if you. When you figure a game plan.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Once we both have a game plan. Like, once we've consolidated on a game plan.  
Them: Yeah, yeah.  
Me: Then we have.  
Them: Yeah. Absolutely. I'm gonna. I'm gonna still put you in a text, and then you can ask him the questions regarding the public tools and see if there's anything else. You can find from him. Because I'm sure it's just building of agents. Like probably with there's a conversational AI he uses.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Specifically and take all of its just pieces that he put together that are all public.  
Me: Totally.  
Them: I don't know it super well, but all I know is, like, yeah, and A11 Labs.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Certain different Claude, like certain. GPT type. Skill sets, but yeah. Cool.  
Me: Yeah, just shoot me a message, intro me to him, and I'll. We'll start a conversation there.  
Them: Sounds good, Miguel. We'll talk soon.  
Me: All right, man.  
Them: Good luck.  
Me: All right, thanks.  
Them: Later.
