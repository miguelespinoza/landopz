# Voice Agents & TCPA Regulations - Official Government Sources

## Executive Summary

As of February 2024, the FCC ruled that AI-generated voices are considered "artificial" under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), requiring prior express consent for all AI voice calls. This effectively prohibits AI cold calling for marketing purposes.

## The Core Regulation: 47 U.S.C. § 227(b)(1)(A)

**It is illegal to make calls using:**
> "any automatic telephone dialing system or an **artificial or prerecorded voice**"

**To:**
- Any emergency telephone line
- Hospital/medical rooms
- Cell phones (without prior express consent)
- Any residential line (for solicitation without prior express consent)

---

## February 2024 FCC Ruling - Critical Change

The FCC officially declared:
> **"AI-generated voices are 'artificial' voices under the TCPA"**

This means ALL AI voice agents (Vapi, Bland, Retell, Synthflow, etc.) fall under the same rules as robocalls.

---

## Consent Requirements for AI Voice Calls

### Marketing/Sales Calls
- **Requirement**: Prior Express WRITTEN Consent
- **Must Include**: 
  - Clear disclosure about AI/automated calls
  - Signature (electronic OK)
  - Phone number to be called
  - Cannot be condition of purchase

### Informational Calls
- **Requirement**: Prior Express Consent (can be verbal)
- **Examples**: Appointment reminders, delivery notifications

### To Cell Phones
- **Requirement**: ALWAYS need consent regardless of purpose
- **Penalty**: Higher fines for cell phone violations

---

## Definition of "Solicitation" (47 CFR § 64.1200(f)(12))

> "The initiation of a telephone call or message for the purpose of **encouraging the purchase or rental of, or investment in, property, goods, or services**"

### The Buying vs. Selling Question

**Potentially Different**: When BUYING land, you're not "encouraging purchase" - you're offering to purchase FROM them.

**However**: 
- No definitive court ruling on this distinction
- FCC hasn't clarified if buying is exempt
- Still considered "solicitation" by many interpretations
- Risk remains high without legal precedent

---

## Penalties for Violations

### Federal TCPA Penalties
- **$500 per call** (unintentional violations)
- **$1,500 per call** (willful/knowing violations)
- **No cap** on total fines
- **Private right of action** (consumers can sue directly)

### Notable Enforcement Examples
- Dish Network: $280 million
- Travel Club Marketing: $75 million
- Health Insurance company: $225 million

### State-Level Penalties (Additional)
- **Florida**: Up to $10,000 per call (Florida Statute 501.059)
- **Texas**: $500-$1,000 per violation (Business Code Chapter 302)
- **California**: $1,000-$3,000 per violation (Public Utilities Code § 2871)

## Legitimate Workarounds & Compliance Methods

### 1. Human-Initiated Dialing (Manual Click-to-Call)
- Human manually dials or clicks to initiate each number
- AI takes over after connection established
- Not considered "automatic" under TCPA
- **Platforms**: CallHub FastClick, Convoso Click-to-Comply™, Dial Flux
- **Source**: https://www.convoso.com/news/press-release-click-to-comply-is-convosos-new-dialer-product-to-support-tcpa-compliance/

### 2. SMS-to-Voice Consent Funnel
- Send compliant SMS first: "We buy vacant land in [County]. Reply YES for info"
- Get response/consent
- Follow up with AI voice call
- **Key**: Response creates "prior express consent"
- **Source**: Industry best practice per TCPA compliance experts

### 3. Business Entity Exemption (B2B Approach)
- B2B calls have different TCPA rules
- Target LLC/Corp-owned properties via county records
- Still need to comply with state laws
- **Less restrictive** than B2C requirements
- **Source**: https://www.manatt.com/insights/newsletters/tcpa-connect/use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-calling-activity

### 4. Inbound-Only Strategy
- Drive traffic through marketing (mail, ads, signs)
- Let prospects call YOU
- AI answers incoming calls
- **100% TCPA compliant** - they initiated contact
- **Platforms**: JustCall AI, Phonely, NLPearl for real estate

### 5. Established Business Relationship
- Previous customers/contacts
- Expired listings
- Tax delinquent properties (arguably expecting contact)
- Properties with "For Sale" indicators
- **Window**: 18 months from last transaction

### 6. Hybrid Human-AI Model
- Human makes initial contact and introduction
- Gets verbal consent: "May I transfer you to my AI assistant?"
- AI handles qualification after consent obtained
- **Key**: Human presence + consent before AI
- **Source**: https://www.retellai.com/blog/ethics-and-ai-phone-calls-are-ai-voices-legal

### 7. Parallel/Progressive Dialing with AI Agents
- AI agents staff progressive dialer campaigns
- Connect instantly when contact answers
- Reduces abandoned calls and regulatory risk
- **Platform**: Regal AI Progressive Dial
- **Source**: https://www.regal.ai/blog/progressive-dialer-for-ai-agents

### 8. Agent-Assisted Dialing
- Trained human agents make dials for sales reps
- Reps focus on conversations while maintaining compliance
- Reaches 10x more prospects with compliance built-in
- **Platforms**: SalesIntel, CloudTalk
- **Source**: https://salesintel.io/blog/agent-assisted-dialing-a-guide/

### 9. Warm Transfer with Context Preservation
- Start with human agent who qualifies interest
- Transfer to AI with full context passed
- No repetition needed from prospect
- **Platforms**: Synthflow, Retell AI with handoff features
- **Source**: https://synthflow.ai/blog/ai-in-cold-calling

### 10. The "Information Call" Approach (Gray Area)
- Frame as: "Calling to see if you'd consider receiving an offer on your land"
- NOT selling anything, gathering information only
- **Risk**: Untested in court, use with caution
- Some investors report success with this framing

### Important Compliance Notes:
- **Disclosure Required** (Post-Aug 2024): Must disclose AI use at call start
- **DNC Scrubbing**: Must check Do Not Call lists every 31 days minimum
- **Record Keeping**: Maintain consent documentation for 5+ years
- **State Laws**: Check state-specific "mini-TCPA" laws (especially TX, FL, CA)

---

## Platform-Specific Policies

### Platforms that PROHIBIT Cold Calling
- **Bland AI**: Explicitly bans cold calling in terms of service

### Platforms that ALLOW with Compliance Requirements
- **Vapi**: Allows but requires TCPA compliance
- **Retell.ai**: Permits with strict documentation requirements
- **Synthflow.ai**: Allows with compliance emphasis

### Note
Even platforms that "allow" cold calling do not protect you from TCPA violations. Legal liability remains with the user.
