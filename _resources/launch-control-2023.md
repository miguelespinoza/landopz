Text Marketing 101 (Part 1) - Getting Started With Launch Control ðŸ’¬

00:00:01 - 00:01:21
[Music] foreign [Music] Faulkner Callan is a genius and she knows that pretty much all the stuff that we need to know about how to do text SMS marketing for the land business and this is a huge point of interest for a lot of people since we had her on the podcast and she broke the news about what was working well for her and a lot of people want to know about this stuff they're hungry for this information so I invited her to come and explain a lot of this for us just so we can grasp how does it work like how do you send the


00:00:44 - 00:01:29
messages out how do you reply what do you say all this stuff we're going to cover a ton of stuff here so we've got a little outline we're gonna go through that count and I put together and I'm just going to let her take it away and I'll try to ask questions as we go through it if if I get confused about anything or if I'm just wondering about stuff chances are other people are going to wonder about that too so I'll sort of interject and ask questions but otherwise she will cover a lot of the


00:01:06 - 00:02:14
basics for us so I'm calling welcome thanks for having me Seth I'm excited to be here yeah me too I will do I'll do a little intro on myself and then we can get into the goods so I uh before getting into land in 2019 I was doing Enterprise CRM implementations and marketing automation implementation so my whole background has been uh automating as much as I can creating efficiencies uh being on kind of The Cutting Edge of of using technology using marketing so when I got into land and we were sending mail obviously my my


00:01:40 - 00:02:35
tech brain was thinking there's probably some other ways that we could get in touch with sellers so I went into a deep dive I looked at every texting tool out there there's a there's a hundred you know it's not there's some that are better than others I landed on a tool called launch control um got my CRM all hooked up with that and then now we're doing a combination of texting mail ringless voicemail we've got some cold calling going on we're also doing some Advanced skip tracing


00:02:08 - 00:03:07
sending emails so that sellers are getting eight to ten touches on the on the marketing side which has proven to be really really successful for us so today we're going to talk uh specifically about texting uh some best practices how it works I do have a company that I created called REI optimize and we do we do implementations of this texting tool for clients we do CRM implementations as well so if you're in this and you're like well I hear what you're saying but I don't want to do


00:02:37 - 00:03:31
this myself uh we're here for you my team or uh we've done over 40 implementations and guarantee our work so would love to chat with anyone that's that's interested but today you're gonna get some Goods so we're ready to ready to rock yeah I'm excited so I think just to kick this all out there's a lot of stuff to cover it's actually kind of a challenge to break down like what do we talk about first and how do we introduce this but to start off overview of texting why did you choose


00:03:05 - 00:03:58
launch control I know there's a ton of different options out there uh what kind of results are you seeing and what kind of numbers have you seen today the biggest thing that I was concerned about was something called tpca compliance anytime we're doing cold marketing to somebody you just want to make sure that you've got all your eyes dotted in these cross even even on the male side I know we there are some areas of the country that there do not males and so we have to be very very careful there we've gone


00:03:31 - 00:04:21
into I've done some Consulting with some of tpca attorneys um I've learned a lot in launch control when they first started they really uh dove into these um these laws and making sure that they are compliant and also I call it kind of bowling with bumpers when you're using the launch control platform they do a lot of things to make sure that you're staying compliant and they're constantly changing the platform to make sure you're compliant so I love that that's what I want out of my


00:03:56 - 00:04:44
texting provider is that you're going to protect me as much as you possibly can so talking a little bit about that I'll just share my screen here we'll just kind of talk about author their website obviously what you're doing here Seth is an evergreen presentation so just know that their website may look a little bit different but this is the uh the launch control tool the launch control website just kind of walking through different options here so they have three different plans I would recommend most


00:04:20 - 00:05:27
people watching this light plan is plenty to start with I always recommend start low you can work your way higher into the pro eventually so this tool allows you to send a batched text messages to potential potential sellers to Property Owners so the flow is we pull our list from a data tree a price to prop stream wherever you want to get your list from and then we have to skip Trace that list which means we have to get phone numbers and emails because when we pull the list out of a data tree or a price you're just getting


00:04:53 - 00:05:42
the property information right you're getting your owner information the acreage the mailing address but we don't have any phone or email tied to that so then we have to skip Trace we'll talk about that in a little bit and then we get into this launch control tool so just to explain a little bit about this light plan so it says 10 000 messages per month again plenty for people that are just starting in the business obviously if you have a team and you've got people that can help take leads in


00:05:18 - 00:06:13
of course you can start talking about getting up on this on this core plan they don't charge per text so it's 10 000 texts a month you cannot make phone calls out of the this tool you can only send text messages out of this tool and then once people respond to your message that's when you can just freehand message them however you'd like so if they do want a phone call you do have to have another phone system of some sort to use I use open phone there's a lot of other phone tools out there to use they


00:05:46 - 00:06:46
do have a skip tracing tool in here it's 15 cents a lead I do not use the skip tracing tool I found it to be cheaper elsewhere now with this one tool they give you something called a market so when you're texting out of launch control everybody gets a market if you go over here on this Market that is the area code that you're sending texts from for example if you're doing investing in Texas I would highly recommend getting an area code in Texas that you are sending texts from you can text anywhere


00:06:15 - 00:07:09
in the country that you want you only get that one area code because they give you 15 miscellaneous phone numbers to send texts from so know that with that lower tier light you get one area code I just recommend getting an area code near the area that you are investing and if you need more markets they are available for sale with launch control with that whole thing you have to get the core in order to get multiple area codes or you could buy just pay a little up charge per area code to do that exactly it's


00:06:42 - 00:07:43
five I think right now it's 500 bucks a month for an additional area code and they are making it I don't know the exact details of the why but I know it is to be compliant with the carriers they are really trying to restrict the amount of numbers that each client has access to interesting um to keep to keep it more healthy you say 500 bucks a month for just for the area code for another area code yes you want to get an additional one so with that core one does that come with two I think the core


00:07:12 - 00:08:09
is still one okay I think the only time you're gonna get two is if you go to the row it says recently changed let's see if we can find it here local phone numbers yeah so you kind of have to be sort of sure about what state or Market you want to be working in right because you'll sort of be limited to that yeah well you can if you have a let's just say you got a Texas area code and you wanted to start texting New York you totally could people are just gonna say like where are you from we just say if


00:07:41 - 00:08:28
someone questions it and we have three area codes right now but if someone did question it in the beginning we would just say hey we're we're originally from XYZ it's where my phone is from but we're very involved in this area and I think it's more of a psychological thing for us honestly than it is people have phone numbers from all over the place in your experience how often does that become a problem where people actively say like where are you from or who are like is it really a big deal or it was a


00:08:04 - 00:09:00
huge deal when we were texting from our Minnesota number which is where I'm I am to Nevada people were like WTF what are you talking about why are you from Minneapolis that was a little bit of a stretch I would say I think it would be a little more realistic if you got more of a Texas number or a Florida number or California number and you were texting these places but it was just a little unusual that it was Minneapolis I think that was that was just too random but you definitely would get if you're


00:08:32 - 00:09:19
looking for highest and best response getting into that Market's area code by far we've seen in our Market Nevada we have that local area code and our response rates are always the highest gotcha and this is going to be separate from open phone or whatever phone service you're using I guess you could probably get multiple area codes from that right when you actually get on the phone call oh yeah totally that's exactly what I say I mean open phone a phone number is five dollars a month you


00:08:56 - 00:09:45
know maybe you're using a Texas area code to do the texting and then you say you know hey a property Specialist or one of our property Specialists would love to call you and then they call from that local phone number that you have from open phone cool okay walk through launch control itself and show like where is everything how do you get around and how to get started let's do it so let's do a little just Psychiatry get your owner list you skip trace it and then the next thing we do


00:09:23 - 00:10:14
is we import that list into this system so we import our sellers with their phone numbers I like to import their age that's a great thing to see right away how old this person is because if they're 80 or 90. let's not try to have a multi-paragraph conversation with them for texting try to get on the phone a little quicker we get that list in there and then what we do is we create something called a campaign so just one question on that list so you're taking your list from say data tree or wherever


00:09:49 - 00:10:45
you're running it through direct Skip and then what they give you back is it basically the exact same list but with some new columns added to it or is it look way different than what you originally submitted how about I show you here what it looks like I'm mainly trying to figure out does that list need to be worked with at all manually by you before you upload it to launch control uh no like the way it comes out so this is what you get from direct skip so you get their the input everything you put


00:10:17 - 00:11:09
in there and then here's all the additional information so you get their matched first name and match last name this is incredible if you have llc's or a trust they're actually going to give you a person and it's so important that we're using this because we're going to want to say no hi Max not hi Johnson Family Trust uh here's yeah right whether or not they're passed and then here's all their phone numbers you'll notice that there's some residential some mobile obviously we


00:10:43 - 00:11:43
can't text the presidential lines those are landlines but we will be able to text the mobiles we get some emails so I've been doing some cool stuff with those more to come on that later that'll be for next V2 V3 this module emailing they're confirmed mailing address very interesting for mail I've had a couple clients use this for mailing instead of the mail that comes out really good results what is that is that like they figured out they actually live somewhere else or yeah yeah so directs get pulls


00:11:13 - 00:12:11
from a database called IDI core and I actually wanted to go direct to IDI Corps but I think you have to pull like 100 000 records a month or something to have access to it so the skip tracing process is basically if somebody goes to rent a car apply for a loan rent an apartment they have to get a credit check and so that credit check that application for credit check goes directly to IDI core that's what their data is so if they're seeing that this person Daniel Gutierrez just did a credit check two weeks ago but he put


00:11:43 - 00:12:38
his mailing address as something different they're gonna pull in the updated address from that database so you do not have to use this you can definitely just keep using the mailing address you had before but it is interesting to see if there was any and I think we see that too this is an owner fix this is if they look at the property address and they actually find a new owner for it that's more recent this often will happen if the property was just sold a couple weeks ago and the county records weren't updated and um


00:12:10 - 00:12:58
there's a new owner there we've got that and then we have this goes on and on and on but they've got relative one and then we have their age and all their phone numbers super helpful when we have you know hey my brother brother and sister are also on the deed or hey we need to get a hold of the neighbor and we need to go back into our direct skip file to look up their information this is where we would come back to and there are a lot of cool things you can do too to do texting to the relatives and that's also


00:12:34 - 00:13:25
something we can talk about so when you get this list back from direct skip which columns are most important like do you need to delete anything or just tell launch control use these columns these are the ones yeah yeah they do the it's like just like mapping so if you've ever imported into Pebble or imported into a crn they'll say hey you know what do you want in uh their phone number the first three phone numbers I don't usually take anything after phone three phone four phone five I haven't found them to be


00:13:00 - 00:13:56
helpful so I we just put in the first three phone numbers I like to bring in the age the match first name and then I like to bring in anything to find the property so I like to bring in the APN I like to bring in the county the state name and then sometimes I'll do like a concatenate so like the last name the match last name I do a concatenate before it comes in with the input last name so that it's easier to look up and map right because if you saw Seth Barton and you looked up Seth Barton in data


00:13:27 - 00:14:25
tree he wouldn't own anything but the Barton family living trust would be the owner yeah so that's a little more advanced if you're an Excel person you're following along but typically what I always do is I import this list first into my CRM system so all of our property all of our contacts all of our properties are all in CRM and then when we have somebody respond I can just look up their phone number right in the CRM and find who that person was what their property information is and this gets in


00:13:57 - 00:14:53
a little bit more advanced but for those of you that are following along even if this is a Google sheet just having a master Google sheet of all of your people and properties and just having the honestly just the sellers let's just talk about this guy so this is Frank he's got a property in Walton Florida and he's right now cold he's never responded to us but when he does respond and does reach out we we Mark him as responded and you could just have this be a little drop down in a Google sheet


00:14:25 - 00:15:19
and the importance of this is because if you guys are going to do let's say you do a round of mail let's say you do a round of texting you only want to text the people that didn't respond to your mailing campaign and we have to start tracking that somewhere who actually responded and then after we do this texting maybe we want to call them or send them another round of mail I want you to be able to come into your to the system or just into Google Sheets or wherever and say hey I want to see all


00:14:52 - 00:15:37
the sellers in this area that are still cold and that's your marketing list for an area so when a person responds you would go into that Google sheet or whatever CRM system and you or your VA would just indicate that they did respond just so that you could sort those appropriately absolutely the other way of doing it is if you want to just do it I'm a little lazy sometimes so I just do it monthly I go into launch control I go to export prospects and I just export everyone that told me they


00:15:15 - 00:16:12
weren't interested asked for everyone that put on the DNC and then I just imported in the serum and just update those records and we we update on the APN one quick question back on the list how you said phone one phone two and four three so is phone one like most likely to be the one like what how are those differentiated that's exactly right yeah most likely to least likely what some of my clients do is anyone that does not have a mobile that's their mailing list right away and there's a


00:15:44 - 00:16:35
lot of people that won't have a mobile on here like Meadows wherever this is oh this is a water authority but probably why they don't have a cell phone number on there and I didn't remove llc's out of here so we can usually assume those phone numbers are cell phone numbers that can receive a text unless they're marked as residential so residential is a landline oh ketchup so it tells you right there okay yep yep those relative phone numbers you mentioned so those don't really get imported but they're


00:16:09 - 00:16:59
just there in case the person happens to say hey contact this person too like that's when you would go back and get it or do you need to okay I do have a couple clients and even myself I have an area in Nevada where we've been marketing to them for three years you better believe I'm gonna send the relatives a texting campaign all the people that are still cold they've never responded I'm gonna pull their their relatives and say you know hey there I'm so sorry if you're not the right person


00:16:34 - 00:16:58
I've been looking for buzzlin I believe you may be related to him we're looking for um we're interested in his property in Pahrump Nevada would you happen to know who he is do I have the right person a little sneaky way of doing it cool

Text Marketing 101 (Part 2) - Campaigns, Message Templates & Drip Automations


00:00:01 - 00:01:22
[Music] foreign [Music] it to launch control we just specify those columns that we just mentioned there and they import those yep that's right we get them in and then it's going to make you create a campaign parent child the parent is the campaign so we could create a campaign oh it's going to maybe create a market This Is My Demo environment uh the campaign would be let's just I'm in Hennepin County Minnesota so let's just say our campaign would be Hennepin County Minnesota and then I live in St Louis


00:00:41 - 00:01:48
Park so maybe we do an import of St Louis Park land um zero to two acres I would assign that to the Hennepin County campaign and then I can keep importing stuff over and over again and just keep pushing it to the same campaign like I have a campaign right now that's actually a Four County campaign and I just keep adding more leads to that and you break those up based on sizes usually or how else would you I kind of break it up honestly for me it's based on the realtors that I have I work really closely with Realtors


00:01:14 - 00:02:04
so it's kind of like okay what Market do you cover and so they're like hey we typically work these four counties it's like okay that's a good good way because my va's work very closely with the Realtors to double check their comps so for me it's just an easy way to organize the other way to organize it is how do you want to do your reporting how do you want to see you know how many hot leads did you get how many people did you put on drip what's your deliverability so


00:01:40 - 00:02:36
some people want to see at Camp county by county which is great I've got a client that works one state and he's going through every single County right now and so he wants to just see every campaign is each County but sometimes he'll import the zero to one Acres first and then he'll import one to five and then five to ten and that makes it a little easier when the texting comes in because it's really overwhelming if you have a lead that's quarter acre and then the next lead is 57 Acres all right so


00:02:08 - 00:02:55
we've imported we've created your campaign and then now it's time to talk about the templates so you've got all your data in there now you're really ready to send text messages but you can't send text if you don't have templates so I want to explain the different types of templates that are in this system here so we have initial text messages these are the first text messages that you would ever send somebody so you have never texted them before and these are the first messages before we do that


00:02:32 - 00:03:23
I'll actually explain the quick replies quick replies are when you're working your inbox there's going to be a little button called quick replies and this is a lot of the stuff that we do Consulting on we write all of our clients templates but you know someone says who is this or how did you get my number or sure I'd love an offer what do you say next so having all these quick replies in there and I actually have like a whole sequence it's called a warm lead sequence the moment somebody says yes


00:02:57 - 00:03:44
they're interested in an offer I have a series of about three text messages that we send to make sure that this person is actually legit because when you're sending text messages out of here it's totally neutral it's basically like sending neutral letters like wondering if you're interested in chatting about a number for your property you're going to get a lot of responses so it's so important that you use these quick replies to make sure this person is actually interested in potentially


00:03:20 - 00:04:15
selling below market value they want to sell quickly we kind of do a little bit of a touch on price and then the big goal is to get them on the phone and I will not get them into my CRM system until somebody has talked to them on the phone super important just a qualifying call is this person legit and I mentioned I work with Realtors a little tip is we get a lot of leads that are great that want to sell for market value introduce them to your realtor that's kind of a way of saying thank you to


00:03:48 - 00:04:35
helping with some of that pricing on the acquisition side and why is it so important to get them on the phone versus just doing everything through texting so that's a great question the problem right now again end of 2022 a lot of the household Sailors are taking on AI and chat Bots to do their texting for them and the problem is that the sellers are catching on they think it's a it's a scam because I mean think about if you've got a random text I was like hey I'll pay you 100 grand for your


00:04:12 - 00:05:01
property or 50 grand for your property it's like who the heck is this is real so we have to this is the same thing that we're doing with mail you have to build the relationship and this industry history is only getting more competitive the properties that we've purchased they've had two or three other offers and sometimes the offers are even better than ours but because we have such a solid relationship we've built trust we've made them laugh we understand their motivation and their pain and


00:04:36 - 00:05:31
their why we've solved their problems we're going to win the deal all day long but that starts with the phone relationship now it's very easy to waste time on the phone too so that's why we want to make sure we're qualifying them a little bit over text to make sure that that five minute phone call and I would not make it more than five minutes we're just asking questions just to qualify it is worth our time and you know the land investor a lot of you guys are probably looking at this like am I going to do


00:05:03 - 00:06:05
this by myself we'll talk about va's in a little bit but if you have a VA I want them to take that conversation for you I don't want them to send you hey can you comp this unless this person is a qualified seller lead gotcha perfect follow-up messages so follow-up messages are what we send after we send an initial text message so we'll send an initial text message now tpca compliance staying compliant um you have to wait 30 days after you send that first message unless they respond to you then you just start


00:05:34 - 00:06:21
working it right if they respond all the compliance things are out the door they respond and that will die out the door I shouldn't say that but a lot of the rules are out the door you can reply as much as you want you can use emojis you can send links but until then you can't do any of that stuff we'll talk about that when we build out our initial messages same thing with follow-up messages we have to wait 30 days and then we can come into this section right here there'll be a little button called


00:05:57 - 00:06:58
create follow-up campaign so let's say we send 2 000 text messages to Hennepin County Minnesota took us about seven days to get through that campaign we'll come back 37 days later and all of those people that didn't respond to our first text will be available for a follow-up campaign and so you'll be a little button right here where it says create follow-up campaign and that's where you can start sending your follow-up messages so initial messages quick replies and then follow messages so


00:06:28 - 00:07:17
initial is just like the first thing you send them quick replies are the pre-made replies to verify that they're legit or there's probably a quick replies for a lot of other purposes too they say you know if they say like no I'm not interested okay well what do we say to that if they say think of anything they could possibly say like uh maybe or I'm already listed with a realtor we've got quick replies all baked out for that so it's like your VA doesn't have to think


00:06:52 - 00:07:46
about oh what should I say it's like no boom boom and we've got this nice flow of just here's the messages if they say no not interested we've got a flow send them a message get him on a drip so they get texted gotcha and then follow-up is if they just don't do anything and you reply 30 days later does that go on like forever or like how long would you follow up before just quitting depends on your area you know if you're loving the area you're making money you're


00:07:19 - 00:08:15
doing deals you're competent I've been texting that same area in Nevada for years I'll never stop you know I'll update the data probably get a relative campaign going maybe there's also person two in that direct skip file we're just gonna dig dig as far as we can go but there's other areas where we texted one time and immediately I could tell that this area has been completely poached by Builders and everyone knew that they wanted market value and it just wasn't worth our time if your messages do not


00:07:47 - 00:08:39
get delivered like if the reason they're not replying is because they're not seeing it or it's not getting their does launch control tell you that like you is there a way to know okay yeah there's deliverability numbers and when we get into my live environment we can uh we can walk through deliverability and then response rates I want to see around a 20 response rate that's what I'm looking for and response is just that could include I hate you don't ever talk to me again okay gotcha and then uh for these


00:08:13 - 00:09:03
different message templates there's lots of control give you anything to start with or do you have to create everything from scratch yourself they've got some stuff that they'll give you but the problem is that it does need to be unique for each person because of the carrier requirements because if the carriers are seeing the same exact messages going out over and over again in different launch control environments that's where they're going to hit you so launch control does help the issue that


00:08:38 - 00:09:29
I had when I was working with them is this is made for household Sailors so it's very you know hey I'm looking about your your house I'm wondering how many bedrooms you know can we get household Sailors jump on the call right away because they don't care really I mean they'll buy any house they don't really care about the condition versus us there's so much many things I have to know does it have Road access is it underwater you know there's a lot more so I don't want to waste my time on the


00:09:03 - 00:09:52
phone so that's why we've had to kind of create our own because it's just a kind of a different conversation and this is part of your secret sauce right because you've done this for so long and you know you know what kinds of quick replies will work and doesn't turn people off and scare people away and all this stuff so just for the listeners and Watchers out there just be aware of that if if you have no idea where to start or if you have something but you don't know if it's the best account can help with


00:09:28 - 00:10:14
this this is something she is really good at thank you yes uh found people smarter than me that do copywriting for a living and I told them what I need and we tested it out with me and 40 other people and we've we've got it pretty dialed in does launch control do they have copywriters who can help with this or can they point you so if somebody's watching this and they just they need to give me something yeah yeah okay yeah so reach out to launch control that's another option they might not know the


00:09:51 - 00:10:40
land business specifically but it could at least give you something to work with they'll get you something to work with Okay so we've got I want to explain one more type of message and it actually exists in a kind of a separate part of launch control and these are called drips drips are huge uh this is also another reason why I chose launch control so a trip is a once they respond to you part of it as I really want them to respond to that first message because that means I can put them on an


00:10:15 - 00:11:26
automated Tech strip if they don't respond I have to keep manually sending those follow-ups every time I want to send a message so let's say they respond and say you know not now maybe later and I just have a drip call maybe later and I say great you know what I'll touch base in a few months and I'll see kind of how things are going so I can say on day 90 I want to say hey first name just checking in still interested in talking about your lot toss an emoji in there now we have to have at least two Tech Spinners which


00:10:51 - 00:12:02
we haven't gotten to yet this is another reason why I love launch control they make you create these things called Tech Spinners so we'll say still interested in still want uh still interested in still open to still want to feel interested in open to want to it doesn't make sense I'm still interested in interested in chatting we'll just do this is that we want to this is what makes it unique right spam or something yeah so we have to have two Tech Spinners in each so just checking in so I'll say


00:11:26 - 00:12:18
just checking in just reaching out so with these Tech Spinners you will notice that this whole thing it doesn't say how many beer relations we have but I can imagine it has 20 different variations of how this message would go out so I could say hey Matt just checking in still interested in chatting about your lot or it could say hey Matt just reaching out still open to chatting about your lot those Tech Spinners are helping create variability it has to have a merge field okay cool and then we're gonna say if he doesn't uh now if


00:11:53 - 00:12:51
he responds we'll come to the top of your inbox and you can adjust from there but if he doesn't respond then let's just say um another three months later hey hey checking in same thing blah blah blah and you can have this baby go for years and years that is the power like one of the biggest powers of launch control is if someone comes in and says not now so many of us if it's if they if they say not now for land or for their mail or they'll they won't even ever respond most of the time you'll never


00:12:21 - 00:13:12
even know they're saying not now but this is amazing where you can just get them on a trip um so that they're getting touches from you for a certain amount of time and then Advanced people tech people you can get them on an email drip in your CRM a tech strip in here and have a reminder to call them quarterly for a lot of the magic happens what exactly gets them on this drip do you have to recognize what they're trying to say like maybe they don't use the words not now but they say


00:12:47 - 00:13:45
maybe later or maybe there's some other way that they word that so it's not like the words triggered but you have to understand it and then put it in there manually exactly yes so if if this is not the right time however they say that they're gonna go on our long-term trip campaign if they if we sent them a text and they originally said yes and then we sent them another one and they didn't respond we're going to put them on a drip called stopped responding and that's going to send them some quicker


00:13:16 - 00:14:12
texts day one day three day four day five it's like hey what's going on how are you doing so we've got probably six different drip messages that we we get in for our clients depending on what they say and so that your VA doesn't have to be manually doing these little follow-up messages we let the system do that work for us say we just imported our list and there's I don't know 5 000 people on there how many of these people should you be sending text to per day and is it just like one text per day and


00:13:44 - 00:14:40
if they don't respond is it like the next day or I don't know just totally understand uh break the volume of it yeah yeah so I like to tell my clients the ones that have a VA working for them that can handle this 5000 to 7 500 texts per month is kind of that sweet spot of where I want them to be that's initial text messages sent inside of that you're going to get responses you're gonna have people saying maybe you're who are you tell me more yes I want to offer you know those type of conversational texts


00:14:12 - 00:15:12
who knows how many that's going to be I don't like to harp too much on that number of text messages because every area is totally different I will say the conversion from text sent to signed purchase agreements right now is .0004 so if you're sending five thousand texts a month I'm assuming you're going to get two signed purchased agreements that month that's like a very high level that's just an average across the board that I'm seeing when I'm looking at the


00:14:43 - 00:15:40
numbers of my different clients and looking at my numbers combined I'm going after higher margin deals I would I won't do a deal under 20 000 but I'm really looking for margins more like Fifty sixty seventy thousand higher the margins the more tax you're going to have to send if you're sending texts to people that are selling their property for 100 200 300 000 that's just a more sophisticated buyer typically someone that's this is an investment for them versus somebody that has a little more


00:15:11 - 00:16:08
of a less expensive property sometimes they don't even know they own it and they don't get narrated it or it just doesn't mean as much there's just not that much importance to them so you probably will be able to send less text to to do more deals gotcha and based on that monthly volume you're talking about I know it doesn't matter that much but the 497 gives you 10 000 outbound messages per month so is that 5075 000 like new contacts or does that include follow-ups and replies great


00:15:40 - 00:16:32
question it does not include any of those conversational messages and it doesn't include any drips it includes first messages and follow-up messages so really people that have not ever responded to you that's what it's counting so you can actually get a lot more messages ten thousand isn't really the limit right oh yeah yeah if you're doing the drips and the conversational stuff yeah yeah they're just talking about like marketing wise and just something to be aware of on the the


00:16:05 - 00:17:16
texting pieces they do cap you per day so they don't want the carriers to see a ton of messages going out per day let's see what we are I think it's the lower tier is 600 messages the cap right now so that's healthy I mean in my opinion that's going to be very healthy for somebody that's getting going now I have a client who sends 7 500 texts per day he's on a custom plan he has 20 people working for him so yeah and he's signing he's getting 30 signed Pas a month from 7 500 text messages a


00:16:41 - 00:17:09
day so you guys can work backwards on that um he has a significant organization that that does very very well so he's obviously ramped up to that over time but this is I would say to start 600 messages a day is plenty gotcha
