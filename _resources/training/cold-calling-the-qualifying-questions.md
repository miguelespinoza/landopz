All right, guys, welcome back. So now I'm going to go over, what if they say yes, they have considered selling, or what's your offer? Right. So I'm going to do a screen share because there's a lot to cover here. And I'm going to show you exactly what we say at lead mining after someone says yes, they want to sell. Okay, so here's our document right here. So here we talked about the intro.
00:22
00:50
Bam. Then we talked about the greet. Right. I'm Nicholas. Have you ever maybe considered selling before? Brilliant. Yes, I am. Or what is your offer? Right. It's something that we will get a lot. So if they ask you, what's your offer? We'll say, well, you know, we normally don't run numbers until we get interest on your end, but if you have some time, I've got a couple questions about the property and then we can move on to the next step.
00:52
01:14
Okay. Then they almost always say yes to that. Right. And then we say, okay, great. So if you could tell a little bit more about the property, just some basic information. The first question here is, is the land mostly cleared? Okay, so now we're trying to find out, is it wooded? Is it cleared? What is. What does the property look like? Is there any utilities on the property?
01:15
01:44
Right. These are a lot of due diligence questions. The beauty of land is we don't have to dive too deep into the personal aspect of the seller. We just want to know, is this piece of land a good fit for our criteria? Right. That's our main thing that we're looking at. So then, is there a road, access to the property? Are there any structures on the property? What were you planning on doing with the property when you bought it?
01:44
02:09
This is almost like a distress question, right? What happened to our hopes and dreams? Right. When you bought this property, you bought it for a reason. Right. Why didn't that reason happen? Okay. That's very important as we move through the process because we want to remind them that, hey, you haven't done anything with it yet. The next best thing you could do is sell it. Right. So what were you planning on doing with the property when you bought it?
02:09
02:34
Next question. What stopped you from doing that? Okay. Again, we're focusing. This is like their motivation to sell if you think about it. Right. Then we're going to. We're going to focus on these key things so we know how to get the property out of their hands and into ours. Do you have a survey for the property? And one of my favorites, would you Be open to receiving monthly payments as well for the property.
02:36
02:59
How quickly are you looking to sell and do you have a better phone number to call back on and when is the best time to call back? Okay, once we got that. Okay, great. Looks like we have everything we need. I'm going to get this over to my partner, Josh, and he's going to give you a call in the next 24 hours. All right, thank you so much for your time.
03:00
03:21
So, boom. Those are the qualifying questions that we want to ask the sellers. Okay. Now, it's very important to get as much out as possible. Not everyone's going to answer all the questions. Right? We definitely know that that's going to happen, but it's the effort that counts. So, for example, when I listen for my cold callers, we want to hear them giving the effort. We want to make sure that they.
03:21
03:49
I want to hear them getting shut down. Right? You don't want to be caught not asking the questions. And at first it's going to be a little uncomfortable for you to probe into these people's lives, but as you get leads and you close deals, you're going to get more and more comfortable when you realize it works and they're not even offended. There's no offensive questions in there. When we call on houses, there's a lot more offensive questions we have to ask, like, is there a mortgage on the property?
03:50
04:18
How much is left on the mortgage? Right. These are not easy questions to ask. People think that's very personal. With land, we have the benefit of not having to get that personal. So don't be afraid to ask all of these questions or at least try to. So you can give either yourself as an acquisition manager or your acquisition manager their best foot forward when working the lead. And a lot of people say, oh, well, Nick, could, could we add some questions to that?
04:18
04:42
Look, I'll be completely honest with you. I tell this to all my clients, you know, and that is, hey, you know, if you want to ask additional questions, those are great things to ask on your follow up call. Right. You know, your acquisition manager needs things to talk about too. We can't just say it, all right? And then they're not going to have anything to talk about. So if you see, oh, I would love to ask this or I'd love to ask that.
04:42
05:06
I would keep the questions the same and then add that to your follow up. So when you actually call the client back, you can use these lighter questions, these other questions, to also help you build rapport. You'll notice with questioning a seller or a lead that you want the questions to start off very easy and get harder as they go. Okay. That's why at the end, we ask them for a better phone number and the best time to call back.
05:06
05:27
Right. So hopefully they trust us after the first several questions. And then the questions get harder and harder. So keep that in mind if you're recreating the script or you're creating a script for your acquisition manager. It's extremely, extremely important that the questions start easy and get harder as they go. All right, guys, let's move on to the next one.
