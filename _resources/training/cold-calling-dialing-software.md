Hey everybody, welcome back. And today we're going to talk about what software you should be using on your dialer. Okay? Now there's a lot of options out there and what I really recommend doing in anything that we do, whenever we're choosing softwares or CRMs or anything, we want to pick the one that's the most user friendly in the beginning. You know, you don't want to spend hours getting nerdy and techy with these dialers.

At lead mining we use call tools and it is for someone who has a whole fleet of cold callers. I have 17 cold callers on and I should be using call tools now. Anyone else who's a solopreneur or doing this on their own or learning how to do this should absolutely just be using Mojo dialer. You could get that@mojo sells.com. okay. And this is a great dialer, all right.

It is very easy to use, very easy to understand. It has a great, even like built in workflow for you so you can upload your records to Mojo dialer. Okay. Whatever you do, don't use their skip tracing. They have included skip tracing. Do not fall for that. It is really bad data. Stick to using either land portal or lead mining for your skip tracing. Do not use Mojo dialers.

A lot of these companies that just added on aren't concerned with quality. It's their job to give you more numbers for you to call, right? Not necessarily, not necessarily give you the most accurate numbers. Right. Then you're probably calling less. So that's something to definitely think about it. So other than that, Mojo dialer, absolutely the best choice. Very easy interface to use. Let me get it pulled up here in the background real quick.

You log in, you select the list you want to dial, you select the phone number you want to use and you click start dialing. Now what I would do if I were you is I would use a triple line dialer when you're calling these people. Now what does a triple line dialer mean? So Mojo offers two options, single and triple. Okay, and then I'm going to recommend the triple line dialer.

It is a little bit more expensive. I think it's like 150 to 180 potentially. But it is really good. And you're going to be able to call three people at the same time. Mojo also has a really cool feature that when we someone connects and they hang up or the system hangs up on them because you're calling three people. So if two people pick up, one will actually get a message from you and then Mojo has a feature where they'll automatically call that person back.

So you're really protected with using Mojo dialer. It's very, it's very beginner friendly and it's going to give you a nice edge to start. So highly recommend that. Can't recommend it enough. In the next video we're going to talk about exactly what KPIs we should track.
