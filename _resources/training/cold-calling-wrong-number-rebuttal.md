All right, guys, this last video in the script section is going to be what to do when there's a wrong number. Okay? I have the perfect script for that, so do not worry. There's a very ninja tip and I would use this every time. It is your job. Well, our job, and your job to get as many leads as humanly possible when calling people. Well, one way to do that is we don't always just take no for an answer.

And wrong number is a form of no. Okay? So I have a rul with my team and we have to always push back at least once to every no that we get, so. Hey, I'm looking for the owner of the three acre property in Galveston, Texas. No. Wrong number. Oh. Oh, my goodness. Yeah, I'm. I'm so sorry. Am I even in the right state? Do you. Do you live in Texas?

Yeah, yeah, I live in Texas. Oh. Oh, you do. Oh, perfect. Well, do you have any properties you'd ever consider selling out there? I buy in the whole state. So now we're looping them back in to being a lead, right When. Oh, wrong number. Okay, bye. Right. And then if they're still not interested, whatever market has a wrong number, get them off of the list. But we have to make sure we're doing everything we can, everything we can to make sure that we are generating a lead.

And a wrong number can be a great lead if you get good at turning wrong numbers into leads. Oh, my friend, you are going to be a very wealthy person. Okay, so keep that in mind. The more leads we generate, the more money we are going to make. So using the rebuttals when they say they're not interested, and then using the wrong number rebuttal whenever they say that they are not the person we are looking for and is extremely important.

We cannot just give up. And this basically covers our entire script session. Okay? We covered it in depth. I'm going to make sure that you have a copy of that exact script to download for yourself. Okay. It'll probably be attached to a couple of these videos so you could access it. And then if you guys have any questions, reach out to me anytime. We're going to get on to the next module.
