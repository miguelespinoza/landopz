The Future of Real Estate Text Marketing: Callan Faulkner Explains What You Must Know!


00:00:00 - 00:00:56
hey folks how's it going Seth here hope you're doing well so I wanted to drop in here and make an updated video for the text marketing 101 for land investors series of videos that I did with Ken fauler so the background was we originally recorded this in late 2022 and then about a year later in 2023 a lot of stuff started changing where AT&T started implementing these new regulations and the launch control the texting platform started forcing an opt out message and the first message that


00:00:28 - 00:01:22
goes out to everybody and uh a lot of people kind of freaked out because this was a big change to the way things were working so I wanted to get on the line with Kellen and get her input on this and figure out okay what exactly has changed what exactly does this mean for us what are we supposed to be doing differently does text marketing still work if so how well does it work what should we expect how do we navigate all these changes so I got on a call with her and to No Surprise it was very very


00:00:56 - 00:01:56
helpful I got all kinds of great information from her and I wanted to share that recorded conversation with you right here cuz I think you'll get a ton out of it so stay tuned I think you'll enjoy this Ken welcome back thanks for having me Seth we have gone through a little bit of a I I've been calling it a kurur fuffle because there was a lot of misinformation um a lot of fear and um I want to talk about where we're at we've had a couple months I think we kind of first started hearing some updates from


00:01:25 - 00:02:32
the carriers in the October time frame it's now January so we've led a couple months go by kind of let the dust settle and a couple updates that uh have come through so first and foremost I'll explain the why behind some of the changes that the carriers are making so the primary culprit and the why behind what's happening is that there are scammers out there that are texting consumers saying things like hey Seth are you still banking with Wells Fargo is the last four digits of your account


00:01:58 - 00:03:01
4498 and people will be like yeah you know what's going on and then they continue on to get account information and obviously scam people mhm um the carriers are obviously trying to prevent that from happening so they are putting in some blocker some algorithms to protect their consumers from scam they're also trying to protect their consumers from from wholesalers um some people like us that people will say stop or I'm not interested and they will not be removed from their list and they will


00:02:30 - 00:03:35
continue to get texted and called and messaged and guess what if someone on AT&T is continuing getting the spam from a company they're asking to be removed from the list they might switch over to T-Mobile or they might go over to Verizon so from a y perspective the carriers obviously don't want their consumers their clients to be upset but they also make billions of dollars on B2B B to excuse me B Toc texting so they've been trying to find a way to make it work for everybody so my big PSA


00:03:02 - 00:03:59
for everyone announcement and I I made it pretty clear in everything I talk about because I'm a big fan of text stand texting still doing great for us I love ringless voicemails I'm now doing cold calling I mail is great too I think we need to be doing multiple touches but it is so important if someone asks to be removed from your list you need to mark them as DNC somewhere if that's in your Pebble environment if that's in follow-up boss if that's in a Google sheet it doesn't matter


00:03:30 - 00:04:31
so that's my little spark of big information there well let's talk a little bit about the template changes so the main huge change is that it is becoming required no matter what platform you're using if you're using twilio or what or just going straight to doing Mass messages on your own you have to give them an opt out so in launch control it's now going to say stop to opt out I have noticed a lower response rate but I have not noticed a lower amount of leads that are coming into our


00:04:01 - 00:04:54
system maybe about 90% of what they used to be but we're getting a lot of the tire kickers out by saying stop to opt out so people will say stop okay fine and then the people that are actually still interested will will come through second thing is we cannot use the first name in the first message so that is a scam trigger remember the message I said before hey call do you still bank with Wells Fargo that is triggering the carriers to feel like it's spammy the saying the first name so now it's the


00:04:28 - 00:05:22
same thing hey there my name is blank with blank we are investing in land in this blank area we're really interested can't say interested we would love to chat with you about yours are you open to a bid are you open to a number are you open to um chatting about your property and then we cannot use lots of numbers so I never recommended putting the APN or the address in the first text but a lot of hous wholesalers do so if you are a hous wholesaler out there do not put the address of their property in


00:04:55 - 00:05:49
the first text the carriers will scan that and they will U Mark that as spam now when you say lots of numbers is it like don't put four digits or more in there one digit what does that mean exactly uh I would say more than four digits yeah I mean we still are putting the acreage like you you know we've been looking at your 8 acre property in blank launch control you know the texting they may launch control is one of the reasons why we love them is they are they're very protective of the rules and the


00:05:22 - 00:06:18
regulations so they may come down on that but for right now I am putting the acreage in there I'm not going after th acre property not opposed but for the most part it's less than one or two digits so I can't specifically call out those 100,000 Acre Properties anymore the multitude out there you're I'm really interested in your big big property yeah you could say that with launch control do they force this opt out message like is it just in there by default or you just have to create your


00:05:50 - 00:06:39
own version of this they're forcing it in so you don't have to do anything literally you write your messages and they just they just tail it on to the end for you and if you were to not use launch control and use something else and not put this in there does that mean AT&T wouldn't deliver it or like um it's mostly AT&T is just not going to deliver it the biggest thing is when you're doing texting you have to be 10 it's called ATP 10 DLC so application to person so if you're using an application


00:06:14 - 00:07:06
to text a person you have to register your EIN number and it's tied to your account so if you're really really you know you're not saying stop you're sending thousands and thousands you know 10 20 30,000 messages a month your people are getting upset yeah you are putting yourself at risk for for from either a Consumer complaint AT&T I don't know if they would do anything they're probably just like no we're just not not gonna deliver these it's not like AT&T


00:06:40 - 00:07:23
is gonna suit you I don't know I'm not an attorney but I've never heard of that before is that kind of the like effectively Shadow ban like they're not telling you they're not delivering it they're just not going to deliver it I actually think launch control can see it on their side the real delivery and I think that's where they started to get really scared cuz scared they were just like why are these not being delivered I don't think we would be able to see it I


00:07:02 - 00:08:00
think launch control would more so be able to see it okay and in terms of uh that op out message there's probably a thousand different ways to tell a person they have the option to opt out launch control has their standard these exact words is what that's going to look like but I mean I don't know could you we're working on that okay yeah I want to get it to a place where there's a little bit more right now they just are like we don't have the technology right now where the u i to even give you the


00:07:31 - 00:08:31
ability to edit that we just need to protect ourselves and our business by just putting a standard on there but there is conversation right now of hey can we like I got a text from I don't know some Senator the other day and it said St o the number two opt out and it was all like condensed in one word it wasn't as clear as like reply stop to opt out I mean you could even say that potentially in a more normal way that doesn't make you look like a solicitor like would you mind hearing more about


00:08:01 - 00:08:58
this or should I not send anything else if you're not interested go ahead and reply stop smiley face okay so you have to specifically call out the word stop or something yeah they they I think they're looking for stop in that first message at least right now okay so in terms of uh the impact this has had on response rates it sounds like you said response rates have gone down but the actual leads has gone down about 10ish per was that right exactly we were at kind of like that 20% response rate now


00:08:30 - 00:09:31
we're about to about we're at about a 12% response rate so response rates are down um but lead conversion is not uh as down as I thought it was going to be to be honest and we've had about two full months of testing I'd say November is when we really ramped no December is always weird with texting we didn't text at all during Christmas so still playing with it but I'm texting is absolutely still my first touch because now I'm weeding out all these people that are like stop never contact me no don't want


00:09:00 - 00:09:47
that okay great get get you out right in the beginning and then my ringless voicemails my cold calls my mail is now going to be all the more powerful and in that initial message I think you might have said it earlier but like what are some examples of like what do you say to have this opt out message and yet not turn people off and maybe there's just no way to get around it but like what are some examples of what you could say in that first Conta hey there we're currently working in the blank area


00:09:24 - 00:10:19
we're planning to pick up a couple Lots would you be open to a discussion for yours Mary was saltera yeah or let's see what this next one that got a response hey there we're scouting the area for vacant land we got your information from the local office could we discuss the price would love to chat you have five minutes today Mar and one of my questions I think you already answered it was you know is this still the first Contact in your sequence looks like you do text and ringless voicemail and


00:09:51 - 00:10:49
ringless voicemail and text and direct mails like way down the list it sounds like texting is still the first thing you do right it's just so easy to it's easy and fast to like get them out it doesn't require a lot of time on the phone time on the phone is a Time suck now I am working on AI cold calling product that will help but right now if someone's on the phone you know how people are they want to talk for 20 minutes about their son's graduation last week so if I can avoid I love


00:10:21 - 00:11:17
getting them on the phone don't get me wrong but I want to have them on the phone with the right people and so if I can just get the text out weed my list down by maybe 20% now I'm just not wasting time as much with the tire kickers when I drop that voicemail and then when I do the call now I know really soon after this happened like I don't know a week or so after the news broke about all these changes going on I thought I heard you mention something about like providing some kind of value in your first messes


00:10:48 - 00:11:40
like hey would you like us to provide an assessment your I don't know something like that are you doing that not part of no no that was originally where launch control was kind of taking it in our message and the way that I train and Coach we do not go for the kill on the first message and there's a lot of wholesalers that do and so I think that's the difference I mean yes of course if you want to lead with value and say like we can do it a free assessment but it's so arbitrary what


00:11:14 - 00:12:10
value is to someone it might be valuable to just get an offer on their property that might be valuable so I think before they were like well AT&T really wants us to lead with value and give value and so there was kind of this conversation of you know giving that want a guide or a PDF and I we did it for a minute and I was like I I don't want to do this yeah just if you if you don't want an offer I just won't communicate with you and if you do then that will be valuable for you with these changes that have


00:11:42 - 00:12:36
happened does this change anything about what kind of people it still makes sense to contact like is it still pretty much all the exact same people like does your list change or anything like that literally got off the phone with a developer yesterday in Ohio for a 50 lot subdivision and it came from launch control so it doesn't matter you know those folks were young too they're in their 40s they've got three kids the sellers and you know the response was sure I'll chat with you you know can we


00:12:09 - 00:13:03
talk and then we've talked about this a lot but we would have never closed that deal if we had not gotten on the phone and we have the people that can have that conversation with her right I mean we knew exactly what to say we answered her questions we made her feel really comfortable the text was the the easiest part about the whole thing just bubbled up the phone call so if somebody just wanted to do something else not launch control ignore these rules forget this whole reply stop opt out and the first


00:12:36 - 00:13:33
thing they could potentially do that the risk is that either AT&T wouldn't deliver the message or possibly the person could be mad or could you get sued over this or something or yeah you could you could get sued if you text someone that where you didn't give them an opt out you didn't give them the they asked to be removed and you didn't yeah I mean there's definitely litigation you could only get sued if they actually found out who you were in your contact info and all this stuff that's exactly


00:13:05 - 00:14:05
right yeah is there any other way they could figure that out or no um no I mean you have to give them your full name I mean if your phone number that you're texting from is registered to your name which in launch control situation it's not and I know some other platforms too your number is registered to the launch control or whatever platform you're using so that's a layer of protection I mean I have sent a lot of texts I have never had anyone Now launch control also runs their list through a provider to


00:13:34 - 00:14:27
remove all the litigators and the DNS so that protects you as well uh so just make sure if you're using your own platform or doing your own thing just make sure you're removing anyone that has ever created tpca litigation and that's like your bare bones and then ideally you're you're removing I wouldn't do direct skip dnc's because they're so broad but I don't know what kind of level of DNC launch controls moving but at least the litigator m folks that's like a Bare Bones removal


00:14:01 - 00:14:59
just out of curiosity if launch controls cease to exist tomorrow is there like some other place you would go like if I couldn't do launch control I'd use this platform instead okay great question launch control died tomorrow I would probably go over to smarter contact for texting I did test it it does the job and it has some of the features launch control does so if for some reason launch control is not working I would um I'd move over there and you're still using fresh sales to keep track of all


00:14:30 - 00:15:31
this stuff fresh sales is kind of like our operations platform follow-up boss is now our communications platform I am obsessed we should do a whole thing on followup boss I am obsessed with follow-up boss I was using it before the phone system is top of the line we have all of our lists of who needs to be called every day I can see how much call time we have I hold our vas we have to be on the phone for at least an hour per person Every Day bare minimum hoping for two hours so if you're doing this at a


00:15:00 - 00:15:59
high level get into a communications platform where you can track calls dials texts uh outside of launch control once you get deleted so it sounds like follow boss that's the real Hub that keeps it all together but fresh sales like what what is the role of that is that like yep in our business we really need this Communications Hub where we're tracking and making phone calls we're emailing someone we're texting someone we're keeping track of who has been reached out to and when should I reach out to


00:15:29 - 00:16:25
them M that's this communication up so that was open phone for me and then we were just doing so we had so many leads that they were falling through the cracks and open phone like they would just go to the bottom of the Inbox and I couldn't set reminders in there and now I'm in launch control excuse me in follow-up boss and I can see all of the people who have not been talked to for more than 12 hours who are in the stage of qualify which means I need to get them on the phone and we can just call


00:15:56 - 00:16:50
through those people now when we get a hot lead we've built an offer ready to send a proposal in pandadoc that's when it's going to now go into fresh sales and we're going to manage them in both places it's like fresh sales is our operations hey we need to reach out to this person at the county you know the purchase agreement has been signed there's 15 things that need to happen now drone photos blah blah blah blah kind of like the Trello aspect or managing the operations of the business


00:16:24 - 00:17:19
that's happening in fresh sales so fresh sales handles the lead full circle whereas boss is more of the what's been communicated on that front end acquisition side that's exactly right y bues are in there as well this is kind of a random question I might just edit this out if you don't have any good ideas on this but do do you know of any creative ways to get prospects to text you first like this idea of putting a QR code on your direct mail campaign where they text you and then you can say


00:16:51 - 00:17:46
whatever you want to them I don't know have you ever played with that or is that uh does that work 100% yeah I mean I think getting a QR code onto a mailer now that postco you know folks that are in their 70s had to use a QR code to see the menu at restaurants like they Now understand what that means I think your mailer should definitely have a QR code and I think it would be great if it takes you to a YouTube video where it's just iPhone selfie hey this is me um I put my phone number down below I'd love


00:17:19 - 00:18:09
for you to text me and just let me know you got this if you have any questions or if you want to just book a call like shoot me a text my number is right below here or my number is 763 blah blah blah just say it the video and just to encourage them like yeah reach out to me text me I'd love to get our conversation going cool and then of course in the mailer always like the fastest way to reach me is to text me it depends on your Vibe on the mailer I like a little bit more of a personal mailer like I sat


00:17:43 - 00:18:39
down to write this to you like hey just text me and let's get a phone call booked so regarding the texting templates so it sounds like really the only thing that's different here is just that initial message like everything else is still pretty much the same as long as you've got that that op do message and you're wording what you can in the optimal way nothing else really changes about what happens after that if they opt out everything is the same if they respond everything is the same is


00:18:11 - 00:19:05
that accurate yeah I would say as long as you know the way I teach things it's like I like to ask questions to them I want them to respond with information you know there there could be people out here that's like oh I'll just get them to respond and I'll just send them an offer and like just try to close them right via text it's like that that is not working and not even something AT&T would want you to do so just tossing that out there like make sure that you are being a kind person and you're not


00:18:39 - 00:19:36
texting people that don't want to be on your list you're not going for the kill you're being more of a consultative sale not too much but asking them questions and um getting answers and getting them on the phone and you talked explain that really well in the uh other videos we did about you know how to have those conversations and essentially like you you want to get them on the phone you're not trying to close on text like the goal is just to like open it up a little bit completely do you anticipate I mean


00:19:08 - 00:20:02
this is an impossible question to answer but do you anticipate any other changes happening to the texting landscape anytime soon or they probably will but who knows what they'll be right I'm sure yeah I'm sure they will I mean like I mentioned before AT&T and these carriers make a lot of money from this type of texting so I think they're going to create a way for it to work I think they're going to be you know as AI starts to improve as their algorithm start to improve they're going to be


00:19:34 - 00:20:32
sticklers I think they're going to be very very strict if you start to not listen or they're having complaints against a number that's tied back to your EIN they're not I think they're going to be ruthless in terms of just getting people out and not giving any second chances so I I don't see that yet but um I'm guessing that is definitely what's coming and then with your services with REI optimize has that changed at all you still have like a white glove service where you set up all


00:20:03 - 00:20:59
of this stuff for people if they're new to texting or ringless voicemail you can show them how it works and implement it and make it happen for the most part is that still exactly I've got recorded curriculum for kind of my launch control program start to finish and then um I have a ringless voicemail program like I mentioned I'm coming out with an AI cold calling program for both outbound cold calling and inbound answering and then I have a community of land investors so we meet every other Wednesday I've got the


00:20:31 - 00:21:27
slack community and then we do tech office hours so support I've got two full-time employees that jump on and hey my import failed or I need to fix this zap what do you think it's very much an environment if everyone is is helping each other hey I figured this out or hey this template's really working so we've really created a cool kind of a group think around lead gen and then I'm also obsessed with just performance and optimization in general so I'm also doing quite a bit of coaching on that


00:20:59 - 00:21:56
sounds like a huge value so yeah REI optimize docomo date with me I mean the best way to get like through this entire thing I mean I was meeting twice a week with my community just here's the changes here's the updates here's what you need to do so that's the best way I mean I am very very close with launch control very close with Sly broadcast I am really trying to be on the Forefront of everything so get in touch with me and we'd love to we'd love to work with you yeah if people want to check out the


00:21:31 - 00:22:26
