# No-Go States for Land Double Closing

## States to Avoid for Land Double Closing Operations

*States are categorized here based on specific legal restrictions, hostile case law, or practical barriers that make double closing impractical, illegal, or economically unfeasible.*

### Explicitly Prohibited States
*States where assignment/wholesaling is explicitly illegal or heavily restricted*

#### Oklahoma ❌ HIGH RISK
- **Status**: Assignment requires real estate license (as of Nov 1, 2021)
- **Law**: Predatory Real Estate Wholesaler Prohibition Act + SB 1075 (2024)
- **Penalty**: Up to 6 months jail + $5,000 per violation

- **Recommendation**: AVOID unless fully licensed or double-closing only

### Severely Restricted States  
*States with major limitations that make operations difficult*

#### Illinois ⚠️ VOLUME LIMITED
- **Restriction**: Only ONE transaction per year without license
- **Law**: RELA 2020 updates
- **Impact**: Cannot scale operations without licensing
