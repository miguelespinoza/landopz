- **[Friendly States](./state-profiles/friendly-states/)** - States that explicitly allow double closing
- **[Restricted States](./state-profiles/restricted-states/)** - States with conditions/limitations
- **[Prohibited States](./state-profiles/prohibited-states/)** - States that prohibit double closing

## Research Methodology
All information is sourced exclusively from:
- State legislature websites (.gov)
- State bar associations
- Verified court opinions
- Title insurance company guidelines
- Legal information institutes (.edu)

Every claim includes specific statute citations and verification dates.

## Business Model
1. Land owner signs Purchase Agreement (PA)
2. PA grants equitable interest to begin marketing
3. Find end buyer before closing with original seller
4. Execute simultaneous/back-to-back closings
5. Profit from spread between purchase and sale price

## Key Questions Answered
- When can marketing legally begin after PA signing?
- Are simultaneous closings permitted?
- What disclosure requirements exist?
- Which title companies handle these transactions?
- What are the cost structures by state?
