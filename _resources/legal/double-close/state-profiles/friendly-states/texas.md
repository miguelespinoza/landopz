# Texas - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ✅ FRIENDLY (With Disclosure Requirements)

Texas allows contract assignments and double closings with specific disclosure requirements to avoid unlicensed brokerage violations.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### Contract Assignment Authority
- **Texas Occupations Code § 1101.0045** (Effective Sept 1, 2017): Person may acquire option or contract interest and assign it **without** real estate license IF:
  1. They do not use it to engage in real estate brokerage
  2. They disclose in writing the nature of equitable interest to any potential buyer

### Written Disclosure Requirement
- **TREC Rules**: Must disclose in writing the nature of equitable interest to any seller or potential buyer
- **Penalty**: Acting without proper disclosure is considered unlicensed brokerage (Class A Misdemeanor per offense)
- **Civil Penalties**: Aggrieved party may recover 1x to 3x the amount received by violator

### Vacant Land Specific Requirements
- **Texas Property Code § 5.010**: Contracts for vacant land must include notice of additional tax liability if land has special appraisal status
- **Platting Requirements**: Division of vacant land may require plat preparation for lots 5 acres or less

## Transaction Structure Options

### 1. Contract Assignment
- ✅ **Legal**: With proper written disclosure
- ✅ **No License Required**: If disclosure requirements met
- **Critical**: Must disclose equitable interest nature in writing before contract
- **Marketing**: Can market contract rights, not direct property ownership

### 2. Double Closing
- ✅ **Legal**: Allowed as principal seller (no license required)
- **Advantage**: Establishes wholesaler as principal, avoiding brokerage classification
- **Structure**: Standard A→B→C simultaneous closings

## Disclosure Framework

### Required Written Disclosures
**To Potential Buyers:**
- "I am selling only an option/contract interest in this property"
- "I do not own this property directly"  
- "This is an assignment of my equitable interest"

**To Property Owner:**
- Notice of intended sale/assignment of contract rights
- Nature of the transaction being proposed

### Timing Requirements
- Disclosures must be made **BEFORE** entering contract to sell option/assign interest
- Written form required (verbal insufficient)

## Cost Structure & Tax Implications

### Transfer Taxes
- **Deed Recording**: Standard county recording fees
- **No Double Transfer Tax**: Unlike some states, no punitive double taxation

### Special Tax Considerations
- **Agricultural/Timber/Wildlife Exemptions**: May trigger additional tax liability notice requirements
- **Public Improvement Districts**: Special assessment disclosure obligations

## Title Company Landscape

### General Acceptance
- ✅ **Widely Accepted**: Texas title companies experienced with double closings
- **Common Practice**: Transactional funding readily available
- **No Attorney Requirement**: Title companies can handle closings (unlike Georgia)

### Best Practices
- Use title companies experienced with wholesale transactions
- Coordinate disclosure documentation with title company
- Schedule closings 2-4 hours apart for same-day double close

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### High Risk - Criminal Penalties
- **Class A Misdemeanor**: Each unlicensed brokerage offense
- **Multiple Offenses**: Can escalate to felony charges
- **Civil Penalties**: 1x to 3x damages plus attorney fees

### Medium Risk - Regulatory  
- **TREC Enforcement**: Active monitoring of wholesaling activities
- **Advertising Restrictions**: Cannot advertise property you don't own

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Written Disclosure Templates**: Use standardized compliant forms
2. **Documentation**: Keep records of all disclosure communications
3. **Legal Review**: Have attorney review disclosure procedures
4. **Title Company Coordination**: Work with experienced providers

## Operational Guidelines

### Marketing Timeline

- **Language**: "Assignment of Contract Rights" not "Property for Sale"
- **Prohibited**: Cannot advertise property itself without ownership

### Contract Structure
- Include assignment language in original purchase agreement
- Use TREC forms where applicable
- Ensure disclosure requirements built into process
