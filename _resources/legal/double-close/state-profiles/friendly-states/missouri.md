# Missouri - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ✅ FRIENDLY (No License Required)

Missouri allows contract assignment and double closing without licensing requirements. Clear regulatory framework under Missouri Revised Statutes with no specific wholesaling restrictions implemented.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### Missouri Revised Statutes Authority
- **Title XXII - Occupations & Professions, Chapter 339**: Governs real estate licensing and activities
- **Missouri Real Estate Commission (MREC)**: State regulatory oversight body
- **Assignment Rights**: Most contracts allow assignments by default under Missouri law
- **Written Contract Requirement**: All wholesale contracts must be in writing and signed

### No Special Wholesaling Restrictions
- **Favorable Environment**: Missouri has NOT implemented specific wholesaling rules/restrictions
- **Contract Assignment**: Legal without real estate license when done properly
- **Principal Buyer Status**: Wholesaler must be the principal buyer on contract

## Transaction Structure Options

### 1. Contract Assignment ✅ LEGAL (Primary Method)
- **No License Required**: Can assign contracts without real estate license
- **Structure**: Transfer equitable rights in purchase contract to end buyer
- **Requirements**: Written assignment agreement with explicit assignment clause
- **Fee Structure**: Assignment fee paid by end buyer for contract transfer

### 2. Double Closing ✅ LEGAL
- **Structure**: Two separate closings with brief ownership period
- **Process**: Close with seller (A→B) then immediately close with end buyer (B→C)
- **Advantage**: Clear principal status eliminates any licensing concerns
- **Requirements**: Access to closing funds or transactional funding

## Licensing Framework & Boundaries

### Activities NOT Requiring License (Safe Harbor)
- ✅ **Contract Assignment**: Selling your contractual purchase rights
- ✅ **Double Closing**: Acting as principal buyer then immediate seller
- ✅ **Marketing Equitable Interest**: Advertising your right to purchase the property
- ✅ **Assignment Fee Collection**: Compensation for transferring contract rights

### Activities REQUIRING License (Must Avoid)
- ❌ **Property Marketing**: Cannot market the property itself without ownership/license
- ❌ **Representing Others**: Acting as agent for buyers or sellers
- ❌ **Negotiating for Others**: Negotiating terms on behalf of other parties
- ❌ **Commission Collection**: Only licensed agents can collect brokerage commissions

### Critical Legal Distinction
- **Permitted**: Marketing your "right to purchase" the property
- **Prohibited**: Marketing the property itself for sale
- **Compliance Key**: Always market the assignable contract, never the real estate directly

## Operational Guidelines
