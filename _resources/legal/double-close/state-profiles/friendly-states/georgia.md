# Georgia - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ✅ FRIENDLY (With Attorney Requirement)

Georgia allows contract assignments and double closings with the unique requirement that all real estate closings must be handled by licensed attorneys.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### Contract Assignment Authority
- **General Rule**: Georgia real estate contracts are assignable **unless** contract clearly prohibits assignment
- **Equitable Interest**: Buyer gains equitable rights upon contract execution that can be legally transferred
- **No License Required**: Assignments permissible without real estate license using proper contract structure

### Attorney Closing Requirement (Unique)
- **Mandatory**: All real estate transactions must be closed by qualified real estate attorney
- **No Title Company Closings**: Unlike most states, title companies cannot handle closings alone
- **Attorney Oversight**: Licensed attorney must supervise entire closing process

## Transaction Structure Options

### 1. Contract Assignment
- ✅ **Legal**: Unless contract prohibits (standard practice to allow)
- **Structure**: Transfer of equitable rights and obligations via assignment agreement
- **Fee Structure**: Assignment fees typically disclosed but can be kept confidential
- **Marketing**: Can begin upon PA execution with equitable interest

### 2. Double Closing
- ✅ **Legal**: Back-to-back closings permitted same day
- **Attorney Coordination**: Both closings must be attorney-supervised
- **Confidentiality**: Allows spread to remain confidential between transactions
- **Funding**: Transactional funding available for same-day closings

### 3. Buy-Sell Agreements
