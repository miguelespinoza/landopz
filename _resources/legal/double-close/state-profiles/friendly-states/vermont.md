# Vermont - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ✅ FRIENDLY (No License Required)

Vermont allows contract assignment and double closing without licensing requirements for proper "bona fide owner" transactions. Clear regulatory framework under Vermont Statutes Title 26 with Real Estate Commission oversight and no specific wholesaling restrictions.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### Vermont Statutes Title 26, Chapter 41
- **Section 2211**: Real estate broker licensing requirements and exemptions
- **Section 2214**: Trust account requirements for licensed brokers
- **Vermont Real Estate Commission**: Administrative oversight and guidance
- **Criminal Penalties**: 3 V.S.A. § 127 - Up to $5,000 fine + 1 year imprisonment

### Assignment Legal Foundation
- **Vermont Statutes Title 27, Section 341**: All real estate assignments must be in writing
- **Recording Requirements**: Assignments affecting landlord/owner rights must be recorded
- **Bona Fide Owner Exemption**: 26 V.S.A. § 2211(b)(1) exempts property owners from licensing

## Transaction Structure Options

### 1. Contract Assignment ⚠️ LEGAL (With Caution)

- **Recording Required**: Must record in town land records for third-party enforceability
- **Licensing Risk**: Repeated assignments may trigger broker licensing requirements
- **Disclosure**: Clear identification of assignment rights and licensing status

### 2. Double Closing ✅ LEGAL (Recommended)
