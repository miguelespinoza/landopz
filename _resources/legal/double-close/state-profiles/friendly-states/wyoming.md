# Wyoming - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ✅ FRIENDLY (No License Required)

Wyoming allows contract assignment and double closing without licensing requirements. Clear regulatory framework under Wyoming Statute Title 33 with established Real Estate Commission oversight.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### Wyoming Statute Title 33 Authority
- **Section 33-28-101 through 33-28-401**: Real Estate Brokers and Salespersons governing statutes

- **Wyoming Real Estate Commission (WREC)**: State regulatory oversight body
- **Statute of Frauds**: All real estate contracts must be in writing

### Assignment Legal Foundation
- **Contractual Rights**: Right to buy property under specific terms can be legally transferred

- **Structure**: Acquire and transfer right to buy property under specific terms
- **Requirements**: Written assignment agreement with explicit terms
- **Marketing**: Can market "right to buy" but not property itself

### 2. Double Closing ✅ LEGAL
