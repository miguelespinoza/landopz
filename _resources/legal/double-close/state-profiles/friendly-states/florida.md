# Florida - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ✅ FRIENDLY

Florida explicitly allows contract assignments and double closing transactions with clear legal framework.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### Contract Assignment Authority
- **Florida Supreme Court**: Real estate buyers are allowed to assign contracts to another party **unless**: 
  1. Contract language specifically prohibits assignment

  3. Assignment would violate state/federal law

### Written Agreement Requirement  
- **Florida Statute Chapter 689**: All real estate transfers for terms over 1 year must be in writing and signed before two witnesses
- Assignment agreements should be drafted by attorneys and executed in writing

### Equitable Interest Recognition
- Florida law recognizes buyer's equitable interest upon contract execution
- This interest can be legally transferred via assignment before closing
- Original buyer typically remains liable unless seller provides written release

## Transaction Structure Options

### 1. Contract Assignment
- ✅ **Legal**: Widely accepted practice
- ✅ **Marketing**: Can begin immediately upon PA execution (equitable interest established)

### 2. Double Closing (Back-to-Back)
