# Illinois - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ⚠️ RESTRICTED (Severe Volume Limitations)

Illinois allows double closing and contract assignments but severely restricts volume - only **ONE transaction per year** without real estate license.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### RELA 2020 Volume Restrictions
- **One Transaction Rule**: Can wholesale **only one property per 12-month period** without real estate license
- **Definition**: "Practice" of wholesaling includes any individual/entity doing more than one transaction per year
- **Licensing**: More than one transaction annually requires full real estate license

### Equitable Interest Recognition  
- **Equitable Conversion Doctrine**: Buyer takes equitable title upon executing enforceable purchase contract
- **Legal Recognition**: Law recognizes beneficial interest even without legal title
- **Assignment Authority**: Equitable interests can be legally transferred via assignment

## Transaction Structure Options

### 1. Contract Assignment (Limited)
- ✅ **Legal**: For single annual transaction
- **Restriction**: Cannot publicly advertise the property itself
- **Marketing**: Must market the contract/equitable interest only
- **Transparency**: Full disclosure required to all parties

### 2. Double Closing (Limited)
- ✅ **Legal**: As principal seller (single annual transaction)
- **Advantage**: Establishes clear principal status
- **Requirements**: Access to funds for first closing
- **Disclosure**: Must disclose profits to all parties

## Volume Limitations & Licensing

### Without License (Annual Limit)
- **Maximum**: ONE wholesale transaction per 12-month period
- **Definition**: Any assignment or double closing counts toward limit
- **Reset**: 12-month period runs from first transaction date

### With Real Estate License

## Operational Guidelines

### Single Transaction Strategy
- **Property Selection**: Must be highly selective given annual limit
- **Profit Margins**: Target higher spreads to justify single transaction
- **Marketing Period**: Allow sufficient time for buyer identification
- **Due Diligence**: Extra thorough vetting given opportunity cost

### Compliance Requirements
- **Full Transparency**: Sellers and buyers must know assignment structure
- **Written Agreements**: Proper documentation of assignment terms
- **Fee Disclosure**: Assignment fees should be disclosed
- **Principal vs Agent**: Maintain principal status to avoid brokerage rules

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### High Risk - Volume Violations

- **Monitoring**: State may track transaction patterns
- **Entity Structures**: Multiple LLCs don't bypass individual limits

### Medium Risk - Marketing Violations
- **Advertising Restrictions**: Easy to inadvertently cross brokerage lines
- **Documentation**: Maintain records showing compliance

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Transaction Tracking**: Maintain careful records of annual activity
2. **Legal Consultation**: Attorney review of marketing materials
3. **Conservative Approach**: Stay well clear of volume limits
4. **License Consideration**: Evaluate full license for volume operations

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Single Transaction Economics
