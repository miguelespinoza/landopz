## Legal Status: ⚠️ RESTRICTED (New 2025 Registration + Disclosure Requirements)

Oregon allows contract assignment and double closing but has implemented significant new regulations effective January 2025, requiring wholesaler registration, disclosures, and creating 3-day cancellation periods.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### House Bill 4058 (2024) - New Wholesaling Regulations
- **Effective Date**: January 1, 2025 (registration), July 2025 (full implementation)
- **Scope**: "Residential property wholesalers" marketing properties they don't own
- **Registration Required**: $300 annual fee + criminal background check
- **Oregon Real Estate Agency (OREA)**: Regulatory oversight and enforcement

### Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS)
- **ORS 696**: Real Estate and Escrow Activities (primary regulatory framework)
- **New Registration Provisions**: HB 4058 amendments to existing real estate law
- **Penalty Structure**: Contract cancellation rights + potential damages

## New Registration Requirements (2025)

### Who Must Register
- **Residential Property Wholesalers**: Anyone marketing property they don't legally own
- **Equitable Interest Holders**: Those with options or purchase contracts marketing to others
- **Exemptions**: Property owners, licensed real estate professionals

### Registration Process
- **Annual Fee**: $300 per year
- **Background Check**: Criminal history review required
- **OREA Oversight**: Oregon Real Estate Agency administration
- **Renewal**: Annual registration renewal required

### Registration Timeline

- **July 2025**: Full disclosure and penalty provisions take effect

## Mandatory Disclosure Requirements (July 2025)

### Three-Tier Disclosure System

#### 1. Seller Disclosures (Written)
- **Wholesaler Status**: Must identify as registered wholesaler
- **No Ownership**: Clear statement of non-ownership of property
- **Cancellation Rights**: 3 business day cancellation period
- **Assignment Intent**: Disclosure of intent to assign/transfer contract

#### 2. Buyer Disclosures (Written)
- **Transaction Nature**: Explain assignment vs. direct sale
- **Wholesaler Role**: Clarify intermediary status
- **Fee Structure**: Disclosure of assignment fees
- **Property Status**: Clarify actual ownership vs. contract rights

#### 3. Broker Disclosures (If Involved)

**Recommendation**: Oregon's new regulations significantly increase complexity and costs while reducing deal certainty. Consider double closing approach or alternative markets unless Oregon-specific opportunities justify compliance burden.

## Strategic Considerations

### When Oregon May Still Work
- **High-Margin Transactions**: Portland/coastal property values justify compliance costs
- **Double Closing Focus**: Avoid assignment complexity entirely
- **Established Operations**: Existing Oregon presence and relationships
- **Legal Resources**: Access to specialized Oregon real estate attorneys

### When to Avoid Oregon
- **Volume Operations**: Compliance costs prohibitive for high-frequency transactions
- **Assignment Preference**: New regulations make assignment method complex and risky
- **Limited Legal Support**: Cannot access specialized Oregon legal counsel
- **Risk Aversion**: Cannot accept 3-day cancellation period uncertainty

### Success Factors for Oregon (If Pursuing)
1. **Early Implementation**: Begin compliance before required deadlines
2. **Legal Partnership**: Ongoing relationship with HB 4058 specialist attorney
3. **System Development**: Robust documentation and tracking infrastructure
4. **Double Closing Preference**: Consider avoiding assignment method entirely
5. **Conservative Standards**: Exceed minimum disclosure requirements

Oregon represents a transitioning market where increasing regulation may favor larger, more sophisticated operations with comprehensive compliance systems over smaller wholesaling businesses.
