# New Hampshire - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ⚠️ RESTRICTED (Complex Licensing Requirements + Legal Uncertainty)

New Hampshire allows double closing but imposes broad real estate brokerage definitions that may capture wholesaling activities. Significant legal uncertainty exists due to lack of specific Commission guidance on modern assignment practices.

### 3. Traditional Purchase-Resale ✅ LEGAL (Safest Approach)
- **Owner Exemption**: Clear exemption under RSA 331-A:4 for property owners

- **Full Compliance**: Standard real estate transaction requirements

## Licensing Framework & Severe Restrictions

## Operational Guidelines (High Compliance Requirements)

### Double Closing Compliance (Recommended Approach)

### Assignment Method (HIGH RISK - Not Recommended)
- **Legal Uncertainty**: Unclear whether assignments trigger licensing under broad definitions
- **Marketing Restrictions**: Cannot advertise property without owner's written consent

### When to Avoid New Hampshire

### Success Factors for New Hampshire (If Pursuing)
1. **Legal Licensing**: Consider obtaining NH real estate license
2. **Attorney Partnership**: Comprehensive legal oversight for all activities
3. **Commission Consultation**: Seek declaratory ruling for business model
