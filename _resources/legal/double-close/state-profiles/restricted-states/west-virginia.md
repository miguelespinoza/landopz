# West Virginia - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ⚠️ RESTRICTED (License Technically Required + Attorney Closing Mandatory)

West Virginia has conflicting interpretations on licensing requirements but mandates attorney closings. Double closing may be safer than assignment for avoiding licensing issues.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### West Virginia Real Estate License Act (Article 40)
- **Technical Requirement**: Act suggests licensing required for wholesaling activities
- **Debate**: Industry disagreement on whether contract assignment requires license
- **Activity Definition**: Listing, advertising, negotiating real estate may require license
- **Commission vs. Fee Distinction**: Licensed agents earn commissions; wholesalers collect assignment fees

### Mandatory Attorney Requirement (Unique)
- **Attorney Closing Required**: ALL real estate closings must be handled by licensed WV attorney
- **Practice of Law**: State considers closing process as practice of law
- **No Title Company Option**: Unlike most states, title companies cannot close without attorney
- **Higher Costs**: Attorney fees add $500-1,500+ per closing

## Transaction Structure Options

### 1. Contract Assignment ⚠️ QUESTIONABLE LEGAL STATUS
- **Licensing Debate**: Conflicting interpretations on whether license required
- **Risk Level**: Moderate to high depending on enforcement interpretation
- **Best Practice**: Consult West Virginia attorney before assignment operations
- **Documentation Critical**: Must clearly show contractual rights transfer, not property sale

### 2. Double Closing ✅ SAFER APPROACH
- **Lower Risk**: Brief ownership establishes clear principal status
- **License Avoidance**: Acting as principal buyer/seller, not agent
- **Attorney Requirement**: Still requires licensed attorney for both closings
- **Cost Impact**: Two attorney fees (A→B closing + B→C closing)

## Licensing Framework & Legal Boundaries

### Activities Likely Requiring License
- ❌ **Property Marketing**: Advertising/listing property for others
- ❌ **Negotiating for Others**: Representing buyers/sellers in transactions
- ❌ **Commission Collection**: Earning brokerage commissions
- ❌ **Repeated Assignment Activity**: May trigger licensing requirements

### Potentially Exempt Activities  
- ⚠️ **Own Contract Assignment**: Selling your own contractual purchase rights (disputed)
- ✅ **Double Closing**: Acting as principal in purchase then sale
- ⚠️ **Single Assignment**: One-off contract assignment (less clear)
- ✅ **Property Ownership**: Buying then reselling as owner

### Critical Legal Distinction
- **Safer Approach**: Market "right to purchase property" as defined in contract
- **Risky Approach**: Marketing or selling actual property without license
- **Enforcement Risk**: West Virginia Real Estate Commission interpretation varies

## Attorney Closing Requirements

### Mandatory Legal Representation
- **Every Closing**: Licensed West Virginia attorney required for ALL closings
- **No Exceptions**: State law considers closing process as practice of law  
- **Document Preparation**: Attorney must handle all closing documentation
- **Title Coordination**: Attorney works with title companies for insurance

### Impact on Double Closing
- **Two Attorneys**: Each closing requires separate attorney supervision
- **Timing Coordination**: Schedule both attorney-supervised closings same day
- **Cost Structure**: $1,000-3,000+ total for double closing attorney fees
- **Document Flow**: Attorney ensures proper assignment/transfer documentation

## Operational Guidelines
