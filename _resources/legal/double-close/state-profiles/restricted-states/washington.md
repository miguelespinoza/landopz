## Legal Status: ⚠️ RESTRICTED (Escrow Agent Requirements + Licensing Risks)

Washington allows double closing and contract assignment but requires escrow agent licensing and has broad real estate brokerage definitions. Recent 2023-2024 legislative changes strengthen consumer protections with gross misdemeanor penalties for violations.
