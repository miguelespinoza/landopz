# Arizona - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ⚠️ RESTRICTED (Strong Disclosure Requirements)

Arizona allows contract assignment and double closing but requires comprehensive written disclosures under HB 2747 (effective Sept 2022). Non-compliance allows contract cancellation.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### HB 2747 Disclosure Requirements (Effective Sept 24, 2022)
- **Scope**: Applies to "residential real property" (fewer than 5 dwelling units)
- **Wholesale Buyer**: Must disclose in writing before entering binding agreement
- **Wholesale Seller**: Must disclose equitable interest and potential inability to convey title
- **Timing**: Disclosures required BEFORE entering binding agreement

### Legal Authority
- **Arizona Revised Statutes**: General contract assignment principles
- **HB 2747**: Specific wholesaling disclosure requirements  
- **Arizona Administrative Code R4-28-1101(E)**: Additional license disclosure if applicable

## Transaction Structure Options

### 1. Contract Assignment ✅ LEGAL (With Strict Disclosure)
- **Required Disclosure**: "I am a wholesale buyer who will assign this contract"
- **Timing**: Must disclose BEFORE binding agreement
- **Format**: Written disclosure required
- **Consequence**: Seller can cancel and retain earnest money if no disclosure

### 2. Double Closing ✅ LEGAL  
- **Structure**: Standard A→B→C transactions
- **Advantage**: May avoid some disclosure complexity
- **Requirements**: Still subject to general wholesaling regulations

### 3. Wholesale Seller Position ⚠️ HIGH DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
- **Required Disclosure**: Must disclose equitable interest + inability to convey title
- **Risk**: Buyer can cancel without penalty if no disclosure
- **Application**: When marketing property under equitable interest

## Disclosure Framework

### Wholesale Buyer Disclosures (To Seller)
**Required Language**: "I am a wholesale buyer entering this contract with intent to assign"
- Must be provided before binding agreement
- Written format required
- Clear, unambiguous language

### Wholesale Seller Disclosures (To Buyer)  
**Required Elements**:
1. "I hold equitable interest in this property"
2. "I may not be able to convey legal title"
- Written disclosure before agreement
- Must be clear and conspicuous

### Licensed Real Estate Professional Additional Requirements

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

### Wholesale Seller Violations  
- **Buyer Rights**: Cancel contract without penalty

## Operational Guidelines

### Vacant Land Considerations
- **Residential Property Definition**: Fewer than 5 dwelling units

- **Raw Land**: Generally not subject to disclosure requirements
- **Caution**: Residential development potential may trigger requirements

### Contract Structure Best Practices
1. **Disclosure Integration**: Build disclosures into standard contracts
2. **Assignment Clause**: Include "and/or assigns" language
3. **Early Disclosure**: Provide disclosures immediately upon initial contact
4. **Documentation**: Maintain records of disclosure delivery/receipt

### Marketing Guidelines
- **Property vs Contract**: Market equitable interest, not direct property
- **Disclosure in Marketing**: Include wholesale buyer status in marketing materials
- **Licensed Professional**: Additional license disclosure if applicable

## Professional Network Requirements

### Essential Partners

- **Title Companies**: Experienced with disclosure requirements and assignments

### Recommended Resources

## Risk Assessment

### Moderate Risk - Disclosure Compliance
