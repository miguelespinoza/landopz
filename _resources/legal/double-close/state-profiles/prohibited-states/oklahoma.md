# Oklahoma - Double Closing Legal Profile

## Legal Status: ❌ PROHIBITED (Assignment Requires License)

Oklahoma effectively prohibits unlicensed contract assignment through the Predatory Real Estate Wholesaler Prohibition Act. Double closing may remain viable but carries significant compliance risks.

## Key Statutes & Legal Framework

### Predatory Real Estate Wholesaler Prohibition Act
- **Effective**: November 1, 2021 (HB 3104)
- **Requirement**: All real estate wholesalers must obtain real estate license
- **Definition**: Anyone "publicly marketing for sale an equitable interest in a contract" requires license
- **Scope**: Applies to all contract assignment activities

### Senate Bill 1075 (2024 Update)
- **Effective**: November 1, 2024  
- **New Requirements**: Mandatory written disclosures and 5-day cancellation period for sellers
- **Definition**: Formal definition of "wholesaler" for residential properties
- **Scope**: Applies if assigning contract on residential property not intended for personal occupation/improvement

### Legal Authority

- **59 Oklahoma Statute § 858-401**: Penalties for unlicensed real estate activity

## Transaction Structure Analysis

### 1. Contract Assignment ❌ PROHIBITED
- **Status**: Requires real estate license
- **Law**: 53 Okla. Stat. § 858-301 - public marketing of equitable interest requires license
- **Penalty**: Criminal charges + civil penalties
- **Risk Level**: EXTREME - Criminal prosecution possible

### 2. Double Closing ⚠️ POTENTIALLY LEGAL
- **Theory**: Two separate transactions with actual title transfer
- **Legal Basis**: Not explicitly addressed in wholesaling prohibition
- **Risk**: Gray area - enforcement unclear
- **Caution**: Still subject to general real estate law compliance

## Criminal & Civil Penalties

### Criminal Penalties (59 Okla. Stat. § 858-401)
- **Jail Time**: Up to 6 months imprisonment
- **Classification**: Misdemeanor offense  
- **Per Transaction**: Each violation treated separately

## Alternative Strategies (High Risk)

- **Risk**: Still uncertain legal ground

### Out-of-State Focus

## Risk Assessment

## Professional Considerations

### Insurance Considerations
