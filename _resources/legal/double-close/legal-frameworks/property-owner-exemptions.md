---

## Legal Framework Analysis

### Statutory Language Patterns

**Strong Exemption Language (Favorable):**
- "Property owner selling own property exempt" (TX, FL, NV)
- "Person selling property they own" (CO, UT, WY)
- "Individual dealing with their own property" (OH, IN, KS)

**Weak/Conditional Language (Caution):**
- "Not engaged in real estate as principal vocation" (PA, IL)
- "Bona fide property owner" (NC, some others)
- "Isolated transaction" limitations
- "Equitable interest excluded from ownership" (NE)

### Critical Legal Distinctions

**Ownership vs. Equitable Interest**
- **Traditional View**: Contract buyer has equitable interest = ownership rights
- **New Trend**: States explicitly exclude equitable interest from "ownership"
- **Impact**: Assignment activities may require licensing even with exemptions

**Marketing vs. Selling**
- **Traditional View**: Property owners can market their own property
- **Restrictive View**: Marketing assignments = brokerage activity
- **Impact**: Disclosure requirements and marketing limitations

**Principal vs. Agent**
- **Safe Harbor**: Acting as principal (actual owner)
- **Danger Zone**: Acting as agent/facilitator for others
- **Gray Area**: Assignment activities may blur this line
