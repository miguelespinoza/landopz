- **Identify deal-breakers early** - Don't waste time on non-viable properties
- **Build rapport** - Remember, relationship building is crucial for competitive deals

## Script Opening

"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I got your text response about your property in [Location]. I work with a network of land buyers and investors who purchase properties for cash. I can typically close within 2-3 weeks if that works for your timeline, and you don't need to do any improvements - we buy land as-is. 

Do you have a couple minutes to chat about your property so I can see if we might be a good fit?"

*[PAUSE - Let them respond and guide the conversation from there]*

## What You're Looking For

- **Motivated sellers** - Need to sell quickly, inherited property, financial pressure
- **Properties that match your criteria** - Size, location, access, buildability
- **Realistic price expectations** - Understand they won't get retail value
- **Clear title** - No major liens or legal complications
- **Development potential** - Can it be built on or used as intended

The goal is to quickly determine if this is worth pursuing further before investing time in detailed due diligence.
