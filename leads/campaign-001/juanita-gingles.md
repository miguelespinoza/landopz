## Deep AI Analysis and Research

### Parcel Overview
The subject parcel is a 6.57-acre lot located on Gingles Farm Trail in Gastonia, NC, within Gaston County. The lot features a mostly rectangular shape with a slight taper, providing efficient use of space and making it favorable for a variety of uses. The land is forested, with moderate to dense tree cover, and there are no existing structures according to public records and visual satellite analysis. The current zoning status is "None" and the land use code is 8000, making the parcel versatile with flexible development potential. There are no known restrictive overlays or conservation statuses. According to the assessor, there is no homestead exemption in place, and the parcel is not used for public or institutional purposes. The site is not landlocked and offers 63 feet of road frontage, which is valuable for access and development.

### Structures
No man-made structures are visible within the parcel boundary. There are no houses, barns, sheds, mobile homes, pools, or other improvement features visible, supporting the assessor's data that lists 0 square feet of building area and no living area on record.

### Vegetation
The parcel is heavily wooded, with an estimated tree cover of approximately 85â€“100%. This indicates mature or semi-mature forest, which could be beneficial for privacy, recreation, or selective forestry. The dense tree coverage may require clearing for residential or agricultural development, but the land appears suitable for either application once cleared. The land does not currently appear to be in agricultural use.

### Trash or Debris
No visible signs of trash, abandoned vehicles, or large debris piles are present within the parcel boundaries.

### Road Access
The parcel is directly accessible via Gingles Farm Trail and is not landlocked. With 63 feet of road frontage, the parcel allows for standard residential or minor subdivision driveway access. The road appears to be a paved or well-maintained gravel road, providing all-season access. No internal driveways or cleared paths are visible within the parcel, so any internal circulation would need to be developed.

### Utilities
No evidence of utilities (electric, water, sewer, or gas lines) is visible directly on the parcel from satellite imagery.
Several neighboring parcels support homes and outbuildings, suggesting utility connections (power, and potentially water) exist nearby and could be accessible with appropriate permitting and utility company coordination.
Given the rural density, city water and sewer are less likely, and private well and septic systems may be required for development.

### Easements
No visible utility or access easements are observed on the subject parcel itself.
The parcel benefits from direct road access and does not appear to provide road/right-of-way access for other parcels.
Investors should review the deed and survey for any recorded easements that may affect development or grant access/utility rights to neighbors.

### Wetlands
The parcel has 0% wetlands coverage, indicating that there are no regulated wetland areas within the boundary. This significantly enhances the attractiveness and developability of the property. Neighboring properties show some wetland presence, but at least one appears to have structures within or near wetland areas, suggesting local precedents for permitting and construction. Still, it is always advisable for buyers to conduct on-site diligence if intending to build near any areas that may be seasonally wet or adjacent to mapped wetlands. Building anywhere on this parcel should not be limited by wetland regulations.

### Flood Zone
The parcel is mapped with 3% flood zone coverage, specifically along the northeastern edge. Most of the property, including areas adjacent to the road frontage, is outside the flood zone and suitable for development. The small area within the flood zone may have restrictions for construction, so care should be taken when siting any structures. Neighboring parcels do have visible homes within flood zones, so local regulations may allow for certain types of construction, but an on-site evaluation is recommended for specific building plans. The flood zone area does not substantially limit the buildable area or access to the lot.

### Notable Features
- Spacious, forested acreage provides privacy and natural beauty.
- Zero wetlands coverage, significantly reducing regulatory hurdles for development.
- Minor flood zone presence (3%) limited to the parcel edge, leaving the majority of the land unaffected and buildable.
- Direct, legal road frontage adds to parcel value and development ease.
- No existing infrastructure or improvements; the parcel is a blank slate for a buyer's vision.

### Surrounding Area
The surrounding landscape consists primarily of similar-sized wooded parcels, small farms, and residential homesteads, demonstrating low-to-medium rural density. There are several established homes and outbuildings nearby, indicating a stable rural community. To the northwest, larger estates and agricultural clearings are present, while to the south and east are more woodland areas. No industrial or commercial land uses are visible in close proximity, and there are no apparent nuisances such as landfills or major highways adjacent to the property. The area is visually attractive and likely quiet, ideal for rural living or recreation. One potential consideration is possible rural service delays for utilities if not already present.

### Development Potential
This parcel offers strong development potential for residential, recreational, or small-scale agricultural uses. Key advantages include zero wetlands constraints, only a minor portion mapped as flood zone (3%), legal and direct road frontage (63 feet), flexible zoning, and a favorable lot shape for subdivision or custom home site planning. The combination of mature tree cover and moderate topography (with the majority of the parcel less than 20% slope) allows for multiple potential building sites, though steeper slopes (especially along the northeast boundary) should be reviewed for drainage and buildability.

**Pros:** Not landlocked, excellent privacy, no wetlands restrictions, minor flood risk, flexible zoning, and significant road frontage. Attractive, wooded setting with potential for homesite(s).

**Cons:** Heavily wooded; land clearing will be required for open uses or residences. Limited utility infrastructure apparent on-site; a well and septic system will likely be needed. Some slopes above 20% may limit usable area for larger developments.

Overall, the parcel is suitable for a variety of development scenarios, especially for a private homesite, recreational property, estate lot, or small farm. The shape and frontage could also allow for subdivision into multiple lots, subject to local planning requirements. The lack of environmental encumbrances and direct access make it an attractive investment opportunity.

1:25 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Yeah.
1:28 - (704) 616-8727: I'm so it always falls through.
1:38 - (704) 616-8727: The one fourth acres that's heir property, you can't find all of those people, and we've been paying tax on it for twenty, twenty five years.
1:39 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Wow.
1:43 - (704) 616-8727: So it's just it that's where we are.
1:48 - (704) 616-8727: It to be petitioned off and surveyed and all that stuff.

1:52 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Yeah.
1:52 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: No.
1:54 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: I I hear you on that.
2:01 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: And so I'm I'm assuming, like, part of the reason you wanna you wanna sell is because of those taxes that you're paying.

2:23 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Yeah.
2:24 - (704) 616-8727: I think they're what?
2:27 - (704) 616-8727: 160, $170 a year.
2:28 - (704) 616-8727: Not bad.
2:29 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Right.
2:30 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Yeah.
2:33 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: I guess the tricky thing is a a fourth of that land.
2:38 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: So how how many claim that a fourth of the portion?
2:46 - (704) 616-8727: There was only one, but the person, mister Floyd died, and he's been dead fifty years.
2:48 - (704) 616-8727: So then it goes to his heirs.
2:53 - (704) 616-8727: And half of them are dead, and we don't know who any others are.
2:55 - (704) 616-8727: That's why it'll have to be dealt with through the courts.
2:57 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Right.
3:00 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Yeah.
3:05 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: That's and so so but I guess you you don't know the specific names.
3:06 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Right?
3:08 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Like, this is something we'd have to investigate.
3:09 - (704) 616-8727: Yeah.
3:19 - (704) 616-8727: The one person that we that at one point we were dealing with, like, two weeks before we were supposed to do something, he died.
3:20 - (704) 616-8727: So no.
3:20 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Wow.
3:21 - (704) 616-8727: Yeah.
3:22 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Wow.
3:22 - (704) 616-8727: Yep.
3:23 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: That's unfortunate.
3:24 - (704) 616-8727: Yeah.
3:30 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: And and these are just relative members that you just haven't like, you don't even know them.
3:31 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Like, you you don't know them closely.
3:32 - (704) 616-8727: I don't even know them.
3:32 - (704) 616-8727: No.
3:33 - (704) 616-8727: No.
3:33 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Yeah.
3:34 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Yeah.
3:35 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: I understand.
3:37 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: So yeah.
3:39 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: I mean, it sounds like you you got pretty far.
3:47 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: You were getting close, and and so I guess once the the gentleman died, like, it moves on to the the next heir.
3:51 - (704) 616-8727: And the next grandchild and the next grandchild and on and on and on.
3:52 - (704) 616-8727: Yeah.
3:52 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Right.
3:53 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Right.
3:54 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: I understand.

3:58 - (704) 616-8727: Mhmm.
4:06 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Honestly, like, you know, between you and me, like, I'm new to this game and, like, I'm I'm I'm I'm willing to learn and figure it out.
4:13 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Because, like, you know, like, part part of what we would do is, like, you know, give you an offer and because, like, I'm I'm a land investor, right, new to this game.
4:20 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: And I'm sure you've talked with others who, like, you know, like, they're they're they're willing to, like, give you an offer, but then they have this title issue.
4:16 - (704) 616-8727: Mhmm.
4:34 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: And so this is new to me, but I have a community of, I guess, like minded people who who, you know, have potentially done this kind of process, this transaction.
4:22 - (704) 616-8727: Yeah.
4:40 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: So I'll I'll I'll lean on the community and see if they have, you know, ways to handle this.
4:47 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: I guess part of this is just but but you own, like, three quarters of it.
4:47 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Right?
4:50 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Like, that's that's kinda currently how it's set up.
4:48 - (704) 616-8727: That's correct.
4:50 - (704) 616-8727: Mhmm.
4:51 - (704) 616-8727: Mhmm.

5:19 - Miguel Espinoza-Gil: Okay.
